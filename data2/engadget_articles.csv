Nicole Lee,You'll start seeing M suggestions in your messages.,2017-04-06T13:00:00-04:00,Facebook's AI assistant is ready to hang out in Messenger,"A couple of years ago, Facebook introduced M , an AI-powered personal assistant for Messenger. The idea behind M is that you could ask it to do pretty much anything -- book flights, cancel your cable service and even find a plumber -- and it'll do it for you, with the occasional help from human beings. It was rolled out to just a small test market of users in San Francisco, but we've not heard much about it since then. Until now. Today, Facebook has announced that a version of M will finally be available to all Messenger users in the US. It's called "" M suggestions ,"" and it'll essentially pop up at certain points of your Messenger conversation to recommend related content or features. In this initial rollout phase, suggestions from M will center around just a few features: stickers, payments, location, making plans, polls and getting a ride. So if you say ""Happy birthday,"" M might pop up a row of stickers featuring balloons and cake. If your friend says ""pay me $10,"" M would then show a link to Messenger's payments function so you can indeed send them their money. If they say ""Where are you?"" M would recognize the query and unveil a shortcut to location-sharing. As for events, if someone says ""Yes, let's meet tomorrow,"" it'll immediately provide a link to create an appointment. For group conversations, it might suggest a poll if people are having a hard time deciding what to do. And if they then talk about how to get to that appointment, it would suggest a couple of Get a Ride options of either Lyft or Uber. Not everybody will see the same M suggestions; the key with M is that it's supposed to be tailored to your particular preference or style of conversation. So if you're not the type to use stickers, you might not ever see the sticker option. ""The personalization is based on established patterns,"" said Stan Chudnovsky, head of product for Messenger. ""It's the AI's decision on what to serve and how."" The idea here is that the more you use it, the more it'll learn about you and tailor the experience to fit your likes and dislikes. But if you don't like M at all, you can mute it in settings. Chudnovsky tells us that the idea of M was to do everything for a small group of people just to see what Facebook could learn from the experiment. That way the team could take the lessons it learned and then implement certain features on a larger scale. As for whether M itself would ever roll out globally, the answer appears to be no, as it would be much too resource-intensive. But something like automated M suggestions is simple enough. Right now, M suggestions don't appear to be as powerful as Google Assistant is in Allo , but this is just the beginning. Get ready for more features in the coming weeks and months as Facebook improves its AI smarts. For now, however, you can get a taste by updating your Messenger app on either iOS or Android as long as you're in the US; global users will have to wait a little longer.",ai
Jon Fingas,It could help understand factors behind cancer and other diseases.,2017-04-05T15:13:00-04:00,AI predicts the layout of human stem cells,"The structures of stem cells can vary wildly, even if they're genetically identical -- and that could be critical to predicting the onset of diseases like cancer. But how do you know what a stem cell will look like until it's already formed? That's where the Allen Institute wants to help: it's launching an online database, the Allen Cell Explorer, where deep learning AI predicts the layout of human stem cells. You only need a pair of identifying structures, like the position of the nucleus, to fill out the rest of the cell's innards. The team learned how to train its AI thanks to gene editing. After reverting adult cells to stem cells, researchers tagged genes to make cell structures glow and track their layout. This helped identify a clear relationship between the locations of cell structures, making it possible to predict how a stem cell would develop. It was just a matter of teaching the AI to understand this relationship, using real-world examples to verify that it was on the right track. There are thousands of images at the Cell Explorer right now, and scientists plan to expand it with snapshots of stem cells as they grow into their adult forms. That could pinpoint key processes and help understand how certain diseases develop. If the database proves successful, you could see more effective treatments for conditions that were once relatively mysterious.",ai
Steve Dent,"Make your website look like ""Total Recall"" or a Michael Bay film.",2017-04-05T09:20:00-04:00,Use AI to turn your favorite film into a color palette,"If you're seeking color inspiration from a distinctive-looking film like Grand Budapest Hotel , you could just ""eyedrop"" it in Photoshop or try an app like Adobe Color CC. Thanks to Vancouver-based developer Jack Qiao, though, there's now a slightly easier way. He came up with Colormind , an AI algorithm that uses films, video games, fashion and art to ""generate color suggestions that fit the distinct visual style of those mediums,"" he says. In coming up with his system, Qiao writes that he first looked at so-called color quantization (MMCQ), in which algorithms extract representative colors from images. However, those colors are often ""haphazard"" and not very useful for design, unlike human palettes that feature ""similar hues grouped together... and some minimum amount of contrast between each other,"" he says. To find a balance between the two, Qiao thought about using a fancy adversarial network deep-learning system, but instead ""settled on a brute-force technique that I call generative-MMCQ."" Basically, it selects representative colors using quantization, shuffles them randomly, and runs them through a classifier, ""the ultimate judge of a 'good looking' color palette,"" Qiao writes. He then trained it on some hand-picked examples, with the aim of making palettes with decent color contrast and a solid theme, while avoiding random-looking ones with poor contrast. After testing it on films like The Godfather Part II , Jaws , Total Recall and random Michael Bay films (that teal and orange ) I found the results to be mixed. Sometimes, it doesn't choose representative colors to my liking, and sometimes the range of hues is inadequate for a design. Since it's pseudo-random, however, you can just keep clicking until you get one that you like. Try it yourself by uploading an image or video and clicking ""generate"" -- it's pretty fun.",ai
Steve Dent,It can also change horses into a zebras or winter to summer.,2017-04-03T08:00:00-04:00,'Reverse Prisma' AI turns Monet paintings into photos,"Impressionist art is more about feelings than realism, but have you ever wondered what Monet actually saw when he created pieces like Low Tide at Varengeville (above)? Thanks to researchers from UC Berkeley , you don't need to go to Normandy and wait for the perfect light. Using ""image style transfer"" they converted his impressionist paintings into a more realistic photo style, the exact opposite of what apps like Prisma do. The team also used the same AI to transform a drab landscape photo into a pastel-inflected painting that Monet himself may have executed. Style transfer has suddenly become a hot thing, apparently, as Adobe recently showed off an experimental app that lets you apply one photo style ('90s stoner landscapes) to another (your crappy smartphone photo). UC Berkely researchers have taken that idea in another direction. You can take, for instance, a regular photo and transform it into a Monet, Van Gogh, Cezanne or Ukiyo-e painting. The team was also able to use the technique to change winter Yosemite photos into summer ones, apples into (really weird) oranges and even horses into zebras. The technique also allowed them to do photo tricks like creating a shallow depth of field behind flowers and other objects. The most interesting aspect of the research is the fact that the team used what's called ""unpaired data."" In other words, they don't have a photo taken at the scene at the exact moment Monet did his painting. ""Instead, we have knowledge of the set of Monet paintings of of the set of landscape photographs. We can reason about the stylistic differences between those two sets, and thereby imagine what a scene might look like if we were to translate it from one set into another."" That's easier said than done though. First, they needed to figure out the relationships between similar styles in a way that a machine can understand. Then they trained so-called "" adversarial networks "" using a large number of photos (from Flickr and other sources) and refined them by having both people and machines check the quality of the results. Ideally, the system would be ""cycle consistent."" Just as you hope to have the original sentence when you translate English to French and back again, you want roughly the same painting when you translate a Monet to a photo and back again. In many cases, other than a loss of pixel resolution, the team succeeded in that regard (above). All is not perfect, of course. Since the algorithms have to deal with a lot of different styles for both paintings and photos, they often fail completely to transfer one to another. As with other systems, one of the main issues is with geometric transformations -- changing an apple into an orange is one thing, but attempting to transform a cat into a dog instead produces a very disturbing cat. The team adds that its methods still aren't as good as using paired training data either -- ie, photos that exactly match paintings. Nevertheless, left on its own accord, the AI is surprisingly good at transferring one image style to another, so you'll no doubt see the results of their work soon in your Instagram feed. If you want to try it for yourself and are comfortable with Linux, you can grab the code here.",ai

Mariella Moon,They'll be used in future zero-emission vehicles.,2017-03-30T09:00:00-04:00,Toyota is using AI to hunt for new battery materials,"Toyota has turned to artificial intelligence for help in the hunt for new advanced battery materials and fuel cell catalysts. The Toyota Research Institute (TRI) is investing $35 million into the project and is teaming up with various institutions and companies, including MIT and Stanford University. According to the automaker's research devision, materials development usually spans decades. By using artificial intelligence techniques, such as machine learning, the researchers can reduce the time it takes to conjure up new materials it wants to use for future zero-emission and carbon-neutral vehicles. TRI Chief Science Officer Eric Krotkov said: ""Toyota recognizes that artificial intelligence is a vital basic technology that can be leveraged across a range of industries, and we are proud to use it to expand the boundaries of materials science. Accelerating the pace of materials discovery will help lay the groundwork for the future of clean energy and bring us even closer to achieving Toyota's vision of reducing global average new-vehicle CO2 emissions by 90 percent by 2050."" Toyota became a leading manufacturer of eco-friendly vehicles thanks to the Prius. In fact, the company announced that it has already sold 10 million of the hybrid cars as of January this year. While the automaker might make the materials this project develops available to its competitors, it has plans to expand its own eco-friendly offerings. The company has been working on fuel cell-powered cars for quite a while, and it announced last year that it's also building its first all-electric vehicle.",ai
Steve Dent,"With camera and hardware integration, the company's personal assistant might actually be useful.",2017-03-29T11:59:00-04:00,Samsung's Bixby AI assistant can see as well as talk,"With its latest Galaxy S8 and S8+ smartphones, Samsung also launched its very own AI assistant, Bixby. We know what you're thinking: Do I really need yet another Android helper bot like Google Assistant or even Cortana vying for my attention? Actually, Bixby might prove to be more useful for Galaxy S8 owners than we expected, thanks to to its tight integration with the smartphones' hardware. Bixby has its own access button on the Galaxy S8 that helps you navigate services, apps and more via voice, touch and text commands. It also comes with a card-centric user interface that looks a lot like Google's former Now app, letting you save cards as reminders for later use. At launch, it will integrate with Samsung's camera, gallery, contacts, messages and settings, and with third-party apps in the future. That will help it ""see"" and do things like shop, translate languages on street signs and more. For instance, you can point the camera at a building in a city, and it will tell you which one it is and give you info about nearby spots where you can find dinner. It's all part of Bixby Vision, which is a way for you to search for things with images alone. Samsung says the technology will work with services like Pinterest , Amazon and Vivino. In one demo, Samsung shows how you can just tell Bixby to ""capture this and send it to Cindy,"" so it contextually knows that you want to do a screengrab and send it to a contact. If you have more than one Cindy in your contacts, it will offer up a menu that lets you select the one you want. All told, the app actually looks better than we expected, and may prove more useful for some chores than Google's Assistant since it works directly with Samsung's hardware. However, we've been similarly enthused about other AI assistants, then rarely used them, so we'll reserve judgement for our upcoming review. Meanwhile, check out the Galaxy S8 and S8+ hands-on looks or the video below. Click here to catch all the latest news from Samsung's Galaxy S8 launch event!",ai
Jon Fingas,Even if they're mostly ads.,2017-03-27T12:44:00-04:00,Spotify's latest acquisition could bring better recommendations,"Spotify's recommendations still leave some room for improvement -- and that's bad for both you and the company's bottom line , since you're not likely to play an irrelevant song or tap on an off-the-mark promo. It might get better before long, however. The streaming music service has bought MightyTV, a startup that revolves around using artificial intelligence and Tinder-like swipes for content recommendations. While the full scope of what the acquisition will mean isn't clear, there will be a strong emphasis on ads. MightyTV founder Brian Adams is becoming Spotify's VP of Technology and will refine the company's ad and marketing tech. The buyout is clearly about the talent rather than the brand when Spotify is immediately shutting down MightyTV in the wake of the deal. This follows a mostly consistent pattern for Spotify, too. A number of its nine acquisitions so far have been related to under-the-hood improvements in recommendations, including Sonalytic (a music discovery outfit bought earlier in March) and Echo Nest. While it's not clear just how much of MightyTV's tech will make it into Spotify, it's not hard to see why Spotify would make a purchase like this. If this leads to smarter music recommendations, you'll be more likely to press play and generate that all-important song revenue. And while Spotify is taking on many paid subscribers , a large chunk of its audience still listens using the free, ad-supported tier. If Spotify can deliver more relevant ads to those customers, it's more likely to get juicy ad deals. And that could be good for you, too. You may not be more likely to respond to ads, but they promise to be less grating.",ai
Daniel Cooper,This is what happens when you let a bot critique your social feed.,2017-03-27T12:00:00-04:00,An AI taught me to be a better tweeter,"My name is Daniel Cooper , and I tweet... a lot. Twitter is an extension of my subconscious, a pressure valve that lets half-baked thoughts escape my mind. In the last seven years, I've tweeted 73,811 times, and yet none of those 140-character messages has made me internet-famous. For all my efforts, I've accrued just 5,635 followers, most of whom are in tech and were probably made to follow me by their boss. It seems that no matter how much I try, I'm never going to become a celebrity tweeter. That gnawing neediness in my soul explains why I was intrigued by Post Intelligence , a startup with a deep learning algorithm that can supposedly make you better at social media. For now, Post Intelligence works with Twitter and Facebook, but there's potential for it to engage with several other platforms. The algorithm is the brainchild of Bindu Reddy and Arvind Sundararajan, two former Google product managers. Reddy can count Blogger, Google Video and Google+ on her record, while Sundararajan helped develop Gmail and AdSense. Together, they previously founded media agency MyLikes and Candid, a Secret -esque anonymous network. Pi, as Post Intelligence is nicknamed, studies your record to learn how you tweet and then looks for patterns to help improve your strategy. It slurps down your most recent 3,000 or so posts, determines your most commonly used words, calculates the scope of your influence and analyzes the sentiment of said tweets. Alas, Pi managed to overestimate my legendary levels of miserableness by marking these jokey tweets as having a negative tone. Why does Doctor Strange insist on being called Doctor when every other surgeon in history gets arsey unless you use Mr / Mrs? The juxtaposition of these two makes me think that alt-J is just a Jamiroquai covers band for racists. pic.twitter.com/bybIXfFCEB Leader Desslok accusing Obama of wiretapping him is pure distraction. Guys, it's time for some Gamilon theory. The platform also examines what times of the day your messages are most likely to get good traction. Given that the bulk of my audience is in the UK and in the eastern US, it's little surprise that my posting windows are 11AM, 1PM and 4PM GMT. So, when I write an explosive tweet with the potential to make everyone in the world chuckle, I should schedule them for those times for the best potential results. But it's the main interface that's the most interesting because it encourages you to look for trending topics to glom onto. The day that I gained access to the platform, a British politician announced that he would take on his sixth concurrent job: editing a daily newspaper. I'd already made several unsuccessful attempts to write a joke on the subject, but this time I could use Pi's rating system as a guide. Before posting each tweet, I ask myself: Does it bring me joy? Will it bring joy to others? I never wait for the answer. You see, rather than issuing a prescriptive system that will tell you what to tweet, Pi's algorithms will give you a rough idea of your tweet's potential. A ""Prediction Bar"" sits below the compose field, giving you a score out of 10 for the messages that you write. It's almost a game unto itself, as you trial-and-error your way toward a hot tweet in the hopes that the system will bless it. My next attempt was to try and satirize Cosmopolitan's decision to go all-in on Jamie Dornan. The Fifty Shades of Grey furniture was plastered above the magazine's Twitter page, presumably in celebration of St. Patrick's Day. Unfortunately, a tweet with a measure of subtlety can fly past the algorithm's senses and, no matter what combination I tried, I only ever got a score of two out of 10. Or, and this is the more outlandish theory, my weird sense of humor isn't actually funny and my whole life has been a lie. I think someone has a crush. pic.twitter.com/qoxhGL7xs0 There's another issue too: Pi can't be used as a full-blown Twitter client -- only as an adjunct to the main site. You can't see the firehose of tweets as the day unfolds, and you have to stop yourself from reacting as you normally would. Rather than firing off a response, you have to pause, switch tabs and then tweet inside the Pi window, checking for your tweet's virality. That's a blessing because you're forced to tweet more thoughtfully, and a curse because you lose the instant gratification that Twitter provides. But what's interesting, at least to me, is how having Post Intelligence in my life has redefined my relationship with the site. Whereas before I would use it almost exclusively upon instinct, typing whole tweet threads upon instinct, now, I just... don't. Instead, I'll try and work out the neatest, highest-scoring phrase for my new master in the hope of getting a higher score out of 10. It's not yet made me internet-famous -- my follower count still remains hopelessly low -- but perhaps I'm not far from my big break.",ai
Jon Fingas,"The strategy is easier, faster and more flexible.",2017-03-26T01:28:00-04:00,'Black box' technique may lead to more powerful AI,"It's not easy to train a neural network. Even if they're not difficult to implement, it can take hours to get them ready no matter how much computing power you can use. OpenAI researchers may have a better solution: forgetting many of the usual rules. They've developed an evolution strategy (no, it doesn't relate much to biological evolution) that promises more powerful AI systems. Rather than use standard reinforcement training, they create a ""black box"" where they forget that the environment and neural networks are even involved. It's all about optimizing a given function in isolation and sharing it as necessary. The system starts with many random parameters, makes guesses, and then tweaks follow-up guesses to favor the more successful candidates, gradually whittling things down to the ideal answer. You may start with a million numbers, but you'll end up with just one in the end. It sounds a bit mysterious, but the benefits are easy to understand. The technique eliminates a lot of the traditional cruft in training neural networks, making the code both easier to implement and roughly two to three times faster. And when 'workers' in this scheme only need to share tiny bits of data with each other, the method scales elegantly the more processor cores you throw at a problem. In tests, a large supercomputer with 1,440 cores could train a humanoid to walk in 10 minutes versus 10 hours for a typical setup, and even a ""lowly"" 720-core system could do in 1 hour what a 32-core system would take a full day to accomplish. There's a long way to go before you see the black box approach used in real-world AI. However, the practical implications are clear: neural network operators could spend more time actually using their systems instead of training them. And as computers get ever faster, this increases the likelihood that this kind of learning can effectively happen in real time. You could eventually see robots that are very quick to adapt to new tasks and learn from mistakes.",ai

For treasury secretary Steve Mnuchin, however, it's apparently business as usual. In an interview today with Mike Allen from Axios , Mnuchin said that technology that could displace jobs was ""50 to 100 more years"" away and that the issue is ""not even on my radar screen."" Mnuchin went on to clarify his comment a bit, noting that he doesn't think self-driving cars use artificial intelligence because ""that's computers and using real technology we have today."" It's a comment that shows his understanding of machine learning and AI to be rather short-sighted and outdated. Mnuchin said that he is thinking more about robots taking people's jobs, invoking the R2-D2 droid from Star Wars, saying that a self-driving car network is ""very different from artificial, you know, R2-D2 taking over your job."" Overall, he said he's ""not at all"" worried about robots or AI displacing jobs in the short term. ""in fact, I'm optimistic,"" he said, referring to the potential of technology to help ""create productivity."" That may be true -- but last December, the Obama administration released a detailed report that claimed automation and artificial intelligence could affect between nine and 47 percent of jobs over the next 10 to 20 years. There's a lot of room for ambiguity in that figure, but even the low end of estimates is still a notable impact. Not surprisingly, the reaction to Mnuchin's comments from tech leaders came swiftly and with much condemnation. Futurist author Amy Web went on a tweetstorm in which she said that Mnuchin's comment was ""one of the most misguided things I've heard from the Trump Admin so far.""

Steve Dent,"Its AI can detect laughter, applause and music for the deaf or hard of hearing.",2017-03-24T09:26:00-04:00,YouTube automates sound effect captions with AI,"YouTube has used algorithms to automatically caption speech for eight years now in an effort to make its billions of videos more accessible for the deaf and hard of hearing. While the feature was pretty rough at first, it has significantly improved it over time, getting ""closer and closer to human transcription error rates,"" Google said in its developers blog. Since speech is just one part of the audio picture, though, YouTube has launched automatic sound effect captioning for the first time. For now, the system can just show three classes of sounds: Applause, music and laughter. ""These were among the most frequent manually captioned sounds, and they can add meaningful context for viewers who are deaf and hard of hearing,"" the company wrote. As with the automatic captions, Google uses machine learning to pick out sounds and display them as text. It developed a ""deep neural network (DNN)"" model for ambient sound, and trained it with ""thousands of hours of videos"" to get the best results. The toughest part, it wrote in a technical blog , was separating and displaying events that tend to occur at the same, like laughter and applause. You can see what that looks like in the clip from America's Got Talent below. The sound effects are merged with the automatic speech recognition and ""shown as part of the standard automatic captions,"" much as you'd see in a close-captioned TV show. YouTube's team said its aware that the captions are ""simplistic,"" but adding features will be easier as it has built a solid back end foundation. In the future, it'll introduce common sounds like barking, knocking or ringing. That will pose new challenges, as the AI will need to figure out if a ringing sound is coming from an alarm, phone or doorbell, for example. It'll be worth the effort, though, as Google says that two-thirds of participants in a study found that sound effect captions enhance the video experience. And while it's bound to make mistakes no matter how good it gets (even humans are only about 95 percen t accurate), users think that the odd error won't detract from the benefits.",ai

The song Midnight Oil from UK-based Shaking Chains uses algorithms to select semi-random bits of video from the hundreds of hours uploaded every minute on YouTube. The result is a music video that's completely different every time you view it. ""I sought to obliquely reframe the stuff we subject ourselves to (whether beautiful, distressing, mundane, frivolous or eroticized) and algorithmically cut them into a new context,"" band member Jack Hardiker tells Vice Creators. The algorithms select footage based on keyword searches chosen by the band, though it declined to name what they are except for one -- ""Black Friday Fights,"" the Thanksgiving brawls that happen in stores across the US over flat-screen TVs. Still, ""the search terms are not fully fixed either -- it's an evolving list... the content can come from anywhere,"" says Hardiker. I sought to obliquely reframe the stuff we subject ourselves to (whether beautiful, distressing, mundane, frivolous or eroticized) and algorithmically cut them into a new context. Once the machine selects the video, it assembles into a complete montage set to the music, just a few moments before you play it. ""What follows has the potential to fascinate, or could well be routine -- but each time is different,"" the page reads. The videos I watched included images like twerking, runway models, puppies and makeup videos, animal documentaries, security camera images, child beauty contests and disasters and war footage. As such, it gives a kind of strange snapshot of the current zeitgeist ""through my search terms and the viewers' attempts to make sense of the sequence,"" Hardiker says. He also notes that while they're a new, small band, they hope the film lives on beyond the cycle of the song itself. ""What might it become a year from now? It would be dependent on what's happening a year from now, on what the internet holds for us then."" You can check it out here.",ai
Richard Lawler,'DynamIQ' technology is the next step beyond 'big.Little' multicore CPUs.,2017-03-21T01:00:00-04:00,ARM's latest CPUs are ready for an AI-powered future,"ARM processor technology already powers many of the devices you use every day, and now the company is showing off its plans for the future with DynamIQ. Aimed squarely at pushing the artificial intelligence and machine learning systems we're expecting to see in cars , phones , gaming consoles and everything else, it's what the company claims is an evolution on the existing "" big.Little "" technology. Originally unveiled in 2011 , that design allowed for multicore CPU designs with powerful, power-hungry chips to do the heavy lifting tethered to smaller, low-power chips that could handle background processing when a device is idle. It's why your phone can edit HD or even 4K video at one moment before sleeping throughout the night without losing all of the battery's charge. DynamIQ lays out a strategy for processors that combine cores specifically designed for whatever task is needed. That could make for a 1+3 (quad-core) or 1+7 (octacore) layout, where each individual core has its own performance and power characteristics. The claim it's making is that this setup can improve responsiveness for AI, with a 50x boost in AI performance over the next 3-5 years, and 10x between the ( still Cortex-A9 ) CPU and specialized ""accelerator hardware."" That matters, especially when one of these chips is using machine learning to drive your car, scanning the road ahead for potential hazards. Of course, it also could be extremely profitable for ARM and the companies that build on its technology (like Qualcomm, NVIDIA, Samsung , Apple and even Intel ), as it claims that after shipping over 50 billion ARM-based chips between 2013 and 2017, it projects the world will buy over 100 billion by 2021.",ai

Fjord (formerly known as Chaotic Moon ) is one of them. So, when the festival sets up around them, it uses the week as an opportunity to show of some of its proof-of-concept (and usually fun) ideas. Enter Party Bot: an app that uses AI in real time to make sure any gathering doesn't get gatecrashed, and has the DJ well-informed on what to play (which is an improvement on a boring Spotify playlist, for sure). Party Bot first needs to know what you look like. Peer into an app and move your face around a bit, and it then matches your name to your face. You can complete your profile by telling it which types of music you prefer, or those that have you leaving the dance floor. Once you're behind the velvet rope and the Cristal is flowing, you can set up cameras/iPads around the party/club/whatever that will spot revelers in the crowd. Knowing who's on the dance floor, and what music they prefer gives even the worst DJ a chance to ease up on the Taylor Swift, and go heavy on the Motörhead (if that's what the audience wants). Other applications could be a simple way to grant access to VIP areas, or offer drinks promotions at the bar (or suggest maybe you've been at the bar a little too much). That's the theory, of course. The reality is that Party Bot is just Fjord showing off what it can do. The app did get involved in the company's own SXSW party, but we missed out on that (we were presumably at a better party, or one without a bot). Instead, we got to try it in a much more sober setting: a pop-trivia quiz in a hotel conference room. Party Bot recognized me, called me by my name and then hit me with some simple questions. My challenge was to get enough right to win a T-shirt. We kinda cheated, as I didn't know who first sang ""Blue Suede Shoes."" (Hint: It wasn't Elvis.) But I got a T-shirt anyway -- and was uninvited to all future parties, no doubt. Click here to catch up on the latest news from SXSW 2017.",ai
Tom Regan,Naval researchers will use a 'MMOWG’ to go up against an AI general.,2017-03-16T12:40:00-04:00,The US Navy wants gamers to stop the rise of the machines,"In a bid to help solve its real-world problems, the U.S Navy has called upon the aid of the most dedicated corner of mankind -- gamers. Launching its own week-long online game on March 27th, the Navy plans to crowd-source ideas in a bid to help them tackle the issue of singularity. While this sounds like the plot to a Terminator prequel, technology's rapid advance has caused genuine concern among the office of Naval Research (ONR) over the rise of highly capable AI. In the browser-based game, contributors will be able to post ideas and interact with other players as together they devise solutions to the futuristic problem. Ideas that manage to reach critical mass in the MMOWG (massively multiplayer online war game) have the potential of being adopted by The Navy and put into action. Dr Eric Gulovsen, director of disruptive technology at the ONR said in a statement: ""Technology has advanced to the point that we can see the Singularity on the horizon,"" he explained. ""What we can't see, yet, is what lies over that horizon. That's where we need help from players. This is a complex, open-ended problem, so we're looking for people from all walks of life-Navy, non-Navy, technologist, non-technologist to help us design our Navy for a 'post-Singularity' world."" This isn't the first time the U.S Navy has used an online game to help them make decisions. Known internally as the Massive Multiplayer Online Wargame Leveraging the Internet (or MMOWGLI) the initiative was first launched in 2011. Previously the service has called upon participants to focus on issues such as how to combat piracy off the coast of Somalia and even tasked players with helping to reduce the Navy's consumption of fossil fuels. Maybe by getting great minds together, they can avoid spending billions on ships that barely work. If you're interested in preventing the rise of Skynet you can enroll here.",ai
Nick Summers,Preparing for a world with fully autonomous robot surgeons.,2017-03-16T09:22:00-04:00,Scientists want to define just how smart robot surgeons are,"For roughly three decades , medical robots have assisted surgeons in the operating theater. They provide a steady hand and can make tiny incisions with pinpoint accuracy. But as robotics improve, a new question has emerged: How should autonomous robots be treated? The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approves medical devices, while medical societies monitor doctors. A robot that can operate on its own falls somewhere in between. To help, Science Robotics has produced a scale for grading autonomy in robot-assisted surgery. If adopted, it could help regulators decide when and how machines should be treated like humans. The system ranges from level zero to level five. The lowest one describes tele-operated robots that have no autonomous abilities. It then rises to level one, where a robot can provide some ""mechanical guidance"" while a human has ""continuous control."" Level two describes a robot that can handle small tasks on its own, chosen and initiated by an operator. Level three allows the robot to create ""strategies,"" which a human has to approve first. Level four means the robot can execute decisions on its own, but with the supervision of a qualified doctor, while level five grants full autonomy. Science Robotics doesn't pretend to have all the answers. It says the overlap between the FDA and medical associations is ""challenging"" and will require an ""orchestrated effort"" from all parties. The research journal is also concerned about the effect autonomous robots will have on human surgical skills. If a machine becomes the dominant choice, it's possible that more traditional techniques -- those that involve a doctor's own hands -- will be lost, or at least downplayed in training courses. As with self-driving cars, there's also an issue of trust. A machine might be more efficient, but what happens when it needs to make a tough, ethically murky call? Who is to blame if a patient or family member disagrees with the decision?",ai
Steve Dent,It aims to stop users from seeing things like neo-Nazi results for Holocaust searches.,2017-03-15T12:15:00-04:00,Google's AI gets human help to avoid offensive search results,"Google is making a new push to eliminate offensive search results such as those that appeared from US neo-Nazi site Stormfront in response to queries about the Holocaust. As Search Engine Land noticed, the site has revised its guide on how to assess search result quality for around 10,000 of its ""quality rater"" contractors. That includes a new ""upsetting-offensive"" content flag for the promotion of violence or hate against minorities and other groups, racial content, graphic violence and human trafficking. On a search for ""holocaust history,"" for instance, Google instructs raters on how to handle two different results (below). The first shows a post from said racist site Stormfront on Holocaust denial, something that's actually a crime in over 20 countries. Google tells raters to flag that with the ""Upsetting-Offensive"" flag ""because of the direct relationship between Holocaust denial and anti-Semitism. Google says the second example from The History Channel doesn't require the ""Upsetting-Offensive"" flag, though. Even though it's clearly an upsetting topic, ""this result is a factually accurate source of historical information"" that, unlike Stormfront , ""does not exist to promote hate or violence against a group of people,"" the document states. Once the raters flag a result, nothing happens immediately. Rather, they're used by Google's coding team and, in turn, its AI algorithms, to improve the search engine overall. Once all that kicks in, someone searching for history about the Holocaust will be less likely to run into a denial site, if things go as planned. However, determined searchers will still find such results if they specifically seek them out by naming a site, Google points out. The company has used the new guidelines with select raters and updated its algorithm late last year. Now, searching with a query like ""did the holocaust happen"" no longer returns Stormfront as the top result and instead surfaces pages from the United States Holocaust Museum. Other queries still turn out questionable results, but Google told Search Engine Land it's ""pleased"" with the raters' work so far. ""We will see how some of this works out,"" said Google engineer Paul Haahr. ""We're learning as we go.""",ai
Jon Fingas,It could represent a step toward truly brain-like computing.,2017-03-14T20:37:00-04:00,DeepMind AI learns to 'remember' previous knowledge,"For all the talk of artificial intelligence becoming increasingly brain-like , there's one area where it frequently falls short: memory. Neural networks usually have to learn everything they need to know about their duties, rather than building on top of existing experiences like real brains do. Alphabet's DeepMind team hopes to fix that. They've crafted an algorithm that lets a neural network 'remember' past knowledge and learn more effectively. The approach is similar to how your own mind works, and might even provide insights into the functioning of human minds. Much like real synapses, which tend to preserve connections between neurons when they've been useful in the past, the algorithm (known as Elastic Weight Consideration) decides how important a given connection is to its associated task. Ask the neural network to learn a new task and the algorithm will safeguard the most valuable connections, linking them to new tasks when relevant. In tests with 10 classic Atari video games , the AI didn't need learn how to play each game in isolation. It could learn them sequentially, taking the knowledge accrued in one game and applying it to the other. The technology is more than a little rough around the edges. It's a jack of all trades, but a master of none. A single-task neural network is still better when limited to one game, DeepMind's James Kirkpatrick says to Wired. It's also not ready to adapt to situations on the spot. The algorithm shows that it's at least possible to give AI memory-like functions, however. And what DeepMind has learned here could shed light on how real brains consolidate information -- it may well validate theories that have existed for years.",ai
Jon Fingas,Baidu just made life easier for interviewers.,2017-03-13T16:57:00-04:00,AI takes the headaches out of transcribing voice recordings,"Ask many interviewers about their least favorite part of the job and they'll almost always point to transcription. It can take hours to turn even a short chat into text, which is a serious pain for everyone from reporters to police interrogators. China tech giant Baidu may have a smarter approach: artificial intelligence. It just released a beta for SwiftScribe , a transcription app that uses a neural network to make sense of speech. The software not only promises relatively accurate speech-to-text processing thanks to training on ""thousands of hours"" of recordings, but learns from edits. It should account more for how people actually speak, saving you from making a load of edits. Don't expect to get into the beta right now. Baidu is inviting just 30 to 50 transcriptionists to participate. The company also has yet to outline the availability and costs (if any) of SwiftScribe when it's ready. However, there's no doubt that this AI-based transcription could be particularly helpful across a wide range of industries. And the technology might be useful outside of interviews, too -- we could easily see it helping with voicemail transcription and anywhere else computers have difficulty understanding the spoken word.",ai
Mariella Moon,The text-to-speech system can also change the emotions the words convey.,2017-03-09T02:45:00-05:00,Baidu's Deep Voice can quickly synthesize realistic human speech,"Baidu has been quietly working on other projects besides self-driving cars at its AI center in Silicon Valley, and now it has revealed one of them to MIT's Technology Review. Apparently, the Chinese tech titan has created a text-to-speech system called Deep Voice that's faster and more efficient than Google's WaveNet. The company says Deep Voice can be trained to speak in just a few hours with little to no human interaction. And since Baidu can control how it speaks to convey different emotions, it can (quickly) synthesize speech that sounds pretty natural and realistic. Google's WaveNet can also synthesize realistic human speech, but it's quite computationally demanding and hard to use for real-world applications at this point. Baidu says it solved WaveNet's problem by using deep-learning techniques to convert text to phenomes, the smallest unit of speech. It then turns those phonemes into sounds using its speech synthesis network. The system converts the word ""hello,"" for instance, into ""(silence HH), (HH, EH), (EH, L), (L, OW), (OW, silence)"" before the speech network pronounces it. Both steps rely on deep learning and don't need human input. However, the system doesn't control which phonemes or syllables are stressed and how long they're pronounced. That's where Baidu steps in -- it switches them around to change the emotions it wants to convey. While the company says Deep Voice has solved WaveNet's problem, it still requires a ton of computing power. A computer has to generate words to say in 20 microseconds to mimic human-like interaction. Baidu's researchers explain: ""To perform inference at real-time, we must take great care to never recompute any results, store the entire model in the processor cache (as opposed to main memory), and optimally utilize the available computational units."" Still, the researchers believe real-time speech synthesis is possible. They've already created quickly generated samples and collected feedback through Amazon's Mechanical Turk. They asked a large number of people through the service to rate the quality of their samples, and the results indicate that they're of excellent quality.",ai
Mariella Moon,It could lead to faster smart devices.,2017-03-07T21:00:00-05:00,NVIDIA launches Jetson TX2 platform for drones and robots,"NVIDIA has launched Jetson TX1's successor at an event today, and it was designed to run twice as fast while drawing less than 7.5 watts of power. The product aptly called Jetson TX2 is an AI platform for drones, robots, smart cameras and other embedded devices. It can be used for navigation, image and speech recognition, among other purposes. Since it's more powerful than its predecessor and was specifically designed for ""edge computing"" -- data processing at or near the source instead of in the cloud or a data center -- it could leader to faster, smarter and more accurate devices. Deepu Talla, vice president and general manager of the Tegra business at NVIDIA, said: ""Jetson TX2 brings powerful AI capabilities at the edge, making possible a new class of intelligent machines. These devices will enable intelligent video analytics that keep our cities smarter and safer, new kinds of robots that optimize manufacturing, and new collaboration that makes long-distance work more efficient."" The chipmaker has also revealed that around a dozen partner companies are already using the TX2 in different ways. Cisco is using the platform for an all-in-one collaboration device that enables screen sharing, interactive whiteboarding and video conferencing. A company called Fellow Robots relies on TX2 to record on-shelf inventory and to detect items and availability in store. The platform also allows Live Planet to stitch 4K 360-degree videos for live streaming. It powers the vision-based algorithms in a compact-yet-powerful MIT drone , as well. NVIDIA is now accepting pre-orders for the TX2 Developer Kit in the United States and Europe, with other locations to follow. It'll set you back $599 to get the carrier-board-and-module combo, but you'll at least get the package when it starts shipping on March 14th. The module-only TX2 is priced at $399, but it won't start shipping until sometime in the second quarter. NVIDIA will also continue selling the TX1 Developer Kit for $499.",ai

The company had initially refused to do so, saying it ""seeks to protect the privacy rights of its customers"" and that Alexa's questions and answers are protected by the first amendment. The case involves Arkansas resident James Bates, who is charged with the murder of a man found dead in his hot tub in November, 2015. The medical examiner ruled that there had been a fight and that the victim, Victor Collins, died from a combination of strangulation and drowning. His body had cuts, bruises and other signs and violence and police found blood in the hot tub, according to court documents. While Alexa is constantly listening, it only records data after the ""Alexa"" or ""Amazon"" commands are given. However, the Echo speaker was reportedly streaming music near the tub, and investigators believe it could have been awakened intentionally or accidentally. If so,the presence of a recording could tell them if Bates was awake when he said he was sleeping, for instance. Our obligation is to investigate all of the available evidence, whether [it] proves useful or not. Bates said law enforcement could review his Echo device because ""he is innocent of all charges in the matter,"" his lawyers said. The prosecutors said they're ""pleased"" to have access to the data, as ""our obligation is to investigate all of the available evidence, whether [it] proves useful or not."" Amazon twice declined to hand over the voice data, saying that its users' requests and Alexa's responses were covered by protected speech laws under the US Constitution. It also claimed that investigators can't prove that they couldn't find the incriminating information elsewhere. However, the suspect's acquiescence means that Amazon's arguments about Alexa's legal rights will remain untested.",ai
Stefanie Fogel,"Neural machine translation now works with Hindi, Russian and Vietnamese.",2017-03-06T21:41:00-05:00,Google's AI-powered translator works with three more languages,"Google wants language translation to sound more natural. Last year, it began moving away from phrase-based machine translation and created an AI-powered system called Google Neural Machine Translation (GNMT). Now, the company says it's expanding GNMT to Hindi, Russian and Vietnamese. GNMT produces higher quality translations than its phrase-based counterparts because it considers the entire sentence instead of breaking it up. It takes each character and compares it to those that come before and after. This is important to deciphering languages like Mandarin Chinese, for example, where words can mean different things based on which characters they're paired with. Google began using neural machine translation with Mandarin Chinese last year, then expanded support to include English, French, German, Japanese, Korean, Portuguese and Turkish. Around one-third of the world's population speaks these languages, TechCrunch notes, and they make up more than 35 percent of all Google Translate queries. Eventually, Google plans to use neural machine translation for all 103 languages in the app.",ai
Jon Fingas,The models could help teams improve their play styles.,2017-03-06T18:04:00-05:00,AI predicts how athletes will react in certain situations,"When you think of sports analysis, you probably think of raw stats like time in the opposing half or shots on goal. However, that doesn't really tell teams how they should have played beyond vague suggestions. Researchers at Disney, Caltech and STATS believe they can do better: they've developed a system that uses deep learning to analyze athletes' decision-making processes. After enough training based on players' past actions, the system's neural networks can predict future moves and create a ""ghost"" of a player's typical performance. If a team flubbed a play, it could compare the real action against the predictive ghosts of more effective teams to see how players should have acted. The Toronto Raptors already have a manual ghosting system where coaches mark out where they think players should have been. This technology, however, lifts that burden. It can create ghosts in real time, even in soccer (aka football) and other sports where the continuous play can lead to predictions that gradually veer from realistic outcomes. The scientists rely on imitation learning, where AI bases its actions on demonstrations, to keep that long-term prediction in check. The early results are promising. In an example soccer match between Fulham and Swansea, a league-average ghost team replacing Swansea performed about as well in a defensive situation... not well at all, unfortunately. However, swapping in the ghost of a strong defensive team dramatically improved Swansea's chances of preventing a goal. Provided this approach can be adapted to both offense and a wider range of sports, you could see coaches offering more specific advice and shoring up weaknesses that might otherwise go unaddressed.",ai
Jon Fingas,A Facebook Messenger conversation could help you start a new life.,2017-03-06T11:41:00-05:00,Parking ticket chat bot now helps refugees claim asylum,"Joshua Browder's chat bot lawyer, DoNotPay , is clearly multi-talented -- after getting people out of parking fines, it's now helping refugees find a home in a new country. Browder has adapted the AI to offer aid to asylum seekers in the US and Canada, and asylum support in the UK. The Facebook Messenger bot turns the asylum application process into a series of simple questions. Once you've finished, you'll have a filled form ready to go. Refugees in the UK still have to apply in person, but those in the US and Canada are largely set once they've finished the conversation. DoNotPay will automatically delete information within 10 minutes of completing a transaction, so it won't store sensitive data after the fact. This isn't a complete solution. Browder still wants to translate the bot into other languages (Arabic is next in line), and it's not going to help much if there are problems with an asylum case. The developer would also like to support WhatsApp in the future. Even so, this could be a big help for refugees who might have trouble deciphering a form, or can't easily make it to a location where they'll get assistance. And Browder believes that even this initial version is particularly useful in the current political climate , where refugees might have to make a sudden change of plans.",ai
Chris Velazco,"If it's mobile, there's probably machine-learning or an intelligent assistant at work.",2017-03-04T11:00:00-05:00,AI continued its world domination at Mobile World Congress,"Silicon Valley investor and web pioneer Marc Andreessen said in 2011 that ""software is eating the world."" The explosion of app ecosystems seems to prove his point, but things have changed dramatically even since then. These days, it might be more accurate to say that ""AI is fueling the software that's eating the world,"" but I've never been very quotable. In any case, it's impossible to ignore the normalization of artificial intelligence at this year's Mobile World Congress -- even if a resurrected 17-year-old phone did end up stealing the show. When it comes to the intersection of smartphones and AI, Motorola had the most surprising news at the show. In case you missed it, Motorola is working with Amazon (and Harman Kardon, most likely) to build a Moto Mod that will make use of Alexa. Even to me, someone who cooled on the Mods concept after an initial wave of interesting accessories slowed to a trickle, this seems like a slam dunk. Even better, Motorola product chief Dan Dery described what the company ultimately wanted to achieve : a way to get assistants like Alexa to integrate more closely with the personal data we keep on our smartphones. In his mind, for instance, it would be ideal to ask an AI make a reservation at a restaurant mentioned in an email a day earlier. With Alexa set to be a core component of many Moto phones going forward, here's hoping Dery and the team find a way to break down the walls between AI assistants and the information that could make them truly useful. Huawei made headlines earlier this year when it committed to putting Alexa on the Mate 9 , but we'll soon see if the company's integration will attempt to be as deep. Speaking of Alexa, it's about to get some new competition in Asia. Line Inc., makers of the insanely popular messaging app of the same name, are building an assistant named Clova for smartphones and connected speakers. It will apparently be able to deal with complex questions in many forms: Development will initially focus on a first-party app, but should find its way into many different ones, giving users opportunities to talk to services that share some underlying tech. LG got in on the AI assistant craze too, thanks to a close working relationship with Google. The LG V20 was the very first Nougat smartphone to be announced... until Google stole the spotlight with its own Nougat-powered Pixel line. And the G6 was the first non-Pixel phone to come with Google's Assistant, a distinction that lasted for maybe a half-hour before Google said the assistant would roll out to smartphones running Android 6.0 and up. The utility is undeniable, and so far, Google Assistant on the G6 has been almost as seamless as the experience on a Pixel. As a result, flagships like Sony's newly announced XZ Premium will likely ship with Assistant up and running as well, giving us Android fans an easier way to get things done via speech. It's worth pointing out that other flagship smartphones that weren't announced at Mobile World Congress either do or will rely on some kind of AI assistant to keep users pleased and productive. HTC's U Ultra has a second screen where suggestions and notifications generated by the HTC Companion will pop up, though the Companion isn't available on versions of the Ultra already floating around. And then there's Samsung's Galaxy S8, which is expected to come with an assistant named Bixby when it's officially unveiled in New York later this month. While it's easy to think of ""artificial intelligence"" merely as software entities that can interact with us intelligently, machine-learning algorithms also fall under that umbrella. Their work might be less immediately noticeable at times, but companies are banking on the algorithmic ability to understand data that we can't on a human level and improve functionality as a result. Take Huawei's P10 , for instance. Like the flagship Mate 9 before it, the P10 benefits from a set of algorithms meant to improve performance over time by figuring out the order in which you like to do things and allocating resources accordingly. With its updated EMUI 5.1 software, the P10 is supposed to be better at managing resources like memory when the phone boots and during use -- all based on user habits. The end goal is to make phones that actually get faster over time, though it will take a while to see any real changes. (You also might never see performance improvements, since ""performance"" is a subjective thing anyway.) Even Netflix showed up at Mobile World Congress to talk about machine-learning. The company is well aware that sustained growth and relevance will come as it improves the mobile-video experience. In the coming months, expect to see better-quality video using less network bandwidth, all thanks to algorithms that try quantify what it means for a video to ""look good."" Combine those algorithms with a new encoding scheme that compresses individual scenes in a movie or TV episode differently based on what's happening in them, and you have a highly complex fix your eyes and wallet will thank you for. And, since MWC is just the right kind of absurd, we got an up-close look at a stunning autonomous race car called (what else?) RoboCar. Nestled within the sci-fi-inspired body are components that would've seemed like science fiction a few decades ago: There's a complex cluster of radar, LIDAR, ultrasonic and speed sensors all feeding information to an NVIDIA brain using algorithms to interpret all that information on the fly. That these developments spanned the realms of smartphones, media and cars in a single, formerly focused trade show speak to how big a deal machine learning and artificial intelligence have become. There's no going back now -- all we can do is watch as companies make better use of the data offered to them, and hold those companies accountable when they inevitably screw up.

While it already has self-harm prevention features, they rely on users to spot and report friends' problematic posts. Now, the company is testing AI tech that can detect comments that are ""likely to include thoughts of suicide."" They can then be checked by the company's Community Operations teams, opening up a new way for troubled users to get help. Facebook's AI is also making it easier for users to help friends in trouble. Using pattern recognition, it will check posts and then, if needed, make ""suicide or self injury"" reporting options more prominent. The AI detection and reporting options, whether aided by friends or Facebook employees, are running as a ""limited test"" in the US for now, however. Facebook has also created new Messenger tools in collaboration with the Crisis Text Line, the National Eating Disorder Association, the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline and other organizations. That'll help at-risk users or concerned friends contact knowledgeable groups over chat either directly from the organization's page or via Facebook's suicide prevention tools.

After hyping a pair of midrange devices and some fun Moto Mod concepts , the company confirmed that it's working with Amazon to bring Alexa to Moto phones. While the first steps of Motorola's Alexa partnership are now well-known, it's the stuff that Motorola later told Engadget about its plans that seems most exciting. Let's start from the beginning. Our first taste of this Amazon/Motorola mash-up will come in the form of an Alexa-powered Moto Mod. It was the star of an all-too-short teaser video that suggested the accessory would be made by Harman Kardon. Dan Dery, vice president of products at Motorola, then hinted that the Mod might launch alongside whatever new flagship the company releases later this year. Remember, Motorola's first Moto Z launched in June 2016, so we might not have to wait too long. As it turns out, developing that modular add-on might be the easy bit. Despite being part of an industry that thrives on secrecy, Dery was candid about the experience Motorola wants to build with Alexa. Part of its vision includes the typical stuff: using Alexa wake-up words to ask the assistant questions and tapping into Alexa's 10,000 skills. Make no mistake, though, while this is in some ways table stakes for having Alexa on a phone, it requires plenty of work. The other, more ambitious part of Moto's plan is to offer a deeper integration in which Alexa -- and perhaps other assistants -- can interpret data about you straight from the phone. Dery admits this is further down Motorola's road map, but it's crucial to giving users a truly valuable experience with mobile AI. ""Today when you talk to Alexa, [your commands] basically always go to services that they have in the cloud,"" said Dery. ""But there is no proper, deep integration with the device."" He used a common example to illustrate his point: He can't tell Alexa to book a table at a restaurant his colleague mentioned in an email. All of that context, stored on phones and in different apps, often exists in silos where services like Alexa can't easily gain access. Companies like Apple and Google don't have to worry about the problem quite as much, since their own virtual assistants can access information from their own, first-party apps. For companies trying to integrate AI from their partners, though, figuring out how to fetch a user's data into realms assistants like Alexa can interpret is crucial. ""The only personal device that can really start to represent you as a user to those services is the phone,"" Dery said. ""There is a wall between the Alexa world and my world as a user. So this is exactly what we're trying to break."" Even with Alexa onboard future devices, Motorola won't force its customers to use it. Motorola's goal, as far as Dery is concerned, is to serve users in an ""agnostic way""; forcing a choice wouldn't be a winning strategy. He wouldn't confirm exactly what existing Motorola devices would gain access to Alexa down the road but noted that Motorola considers Alexa and assistants like it part of its Moto Experiences and will soon formalize backward and forward compatibility rules for those features. For now, it's unclear whether Motorola's approach to Alexa integration is an exception or a rule. Huawei announced a similar deal earlier this year at CES, where new Mate 9 smartphones would come with Alexa on board and models in the wild would get an update. Beyond that, Huawei has been quiet about exactly how this partnership will work. A trusted, anonymous source points to an integration deeper than just plopping an Alexa icon on the home screen, adding that Alexa will likely become available on Mate 9s in March. Still, the AI push is a pronounced one across the industry. Apple and Google have Siri and Google Assistant, respectively. (The latter, by the way, is now widely available.) Huawei is using machine learning algorithms to optimize its phones' performance. HTC's flagship U Ultra has a second screen where its HTC Companion is supposed to live. The race is on to see who can achieve the best blend of AI and features that feed into it, and we'll all benefit from the outcome. Click here to catch up on the latest news from MWC 2017.",ai
Jon Fingas,It's not just the usual digital punching bag.,2017-02-26T20:45:00-05:00,MIT's 'Super Smash Bros.' AI can compete with veteran players,"For expert players, most video game AI amounts to little more than target practice -- especially in fighting games, where it rarely accounts for the subtleties of human behavior. At MIT, though, they've developed a Super Smash Bros. Melee AI that should make even seasoned veterans sweat a little. The CSAIL team trained a neural network to fight by handing it the coordinates of game objects, and giving it incentives to play in ways that should secure a win. The result is an AI brawler that has largely learned to fight on its own -- and is good enough to usually prevail over players ranked in the top 100 worldwide. Lead researcher Vlad Firoiu tells our TechCrunch colleagues that the SSBM AI is at once very calculating and knowingly reckless. It will sometimes turtle (that is, refuse to attack) until it's sure there's an opening, but it will just as readily leap off the stage when it sees an opportunity for a quick but relatively risky victory. And since this is AI, it has reflexes that humans can't usually match. This doesn't mean that you're going to see the neural network participating in formal competition, like you saw with Google's DeepMind. It doesn't know how to deal with projectiles (rendering it useless with many SSBM characters), and you can make it panic if you hide in the corner. However, this is a good demonstration of how deep learning AI can cope with new environments. It also suggests that game developers could use neural networks to provide a serious single-player challenge at the highest skill levels, giving pros a way to practice when similarly-ranked rivals aren't available.",ai

As of this week, the AI helper will start rolling out to Android phones running Marshmallow or Nougat. So long as your phone has Google Play Services and meets some basic specs (at least 1.5GB of RAM and a 720p screen), you too can use Android's native search app to get answers and issue commands through Google's conversational companion. Just where and when you'll get it will vary, though. The initial rollout will focus on English-speaking users in the US. Australians and Canadians will be next in line for English support, while Germans will also get it in their native language. Other languages are due in the ""coming year,"" Google says. And if you insist on getting Assistant with your next phone, you won't have to be too picky.

Now, it's ready to look at the patients themselves -- or rather, their body scans. It's following up on past promises by launching Watson Clinical Imaging Review, its first picture-based cognitive computing solution. The AI platform can sift through ultrasounds, x-rays and other medical data to both fill out health records and identify patients who might need critical care. The imaging tech will first be used to diagnose patients with aortic stenosis, where the heart's aortic valve narrows and constricts blood flow. Watson will combine heart imagery with medical records to spot patients who might need follow-up treatments. The approach will eventually expand to cover heart attacks, heart muscle disease, deep vein thrombosis and valve disorders. IBM won't make the solution widely available to health care facilities until later in the year, but it's hoping that the impact will be worth the wait. In a chat with Mashable , the company's Anne Le Grand says that Watson promises to improve both the quality and consistency of diagnoses. Both patients and doctors won't have to worry so much about issues going unaddressed until they become urgent.",ai

Jon Fingas,Its low-power design learns and remembers through electrical signals.,2017-02-21T09:43:00-05:00,Artificial synapse could be key to brain-like computing,"If you're going to craft brain-like computers , it stands to reason that you'd want to replicate brain-like behavior right down to the smallest elements, doesn't it? Sure enough, researchers have managed just that. They've developed an artificial synapse that imitates the real thing by both learning and remembering whenever electrical signals cross -- most previous attempts at this can only manage one action at a time. You only have to discharge and recharge the synapse at specific voltages to program it, and it promises to be far more power-efficient than conventional approaches to brain-like operation. The battery-like hardware is built from two flexible films whose terminals are linked by a salty water electrolyte. It behaves like a transistor, with one terminal regulating the electricity flowing between two others. While it's not exactly natural, it's largely made out of carbon and hydrogen, and should be compatible with a real brain's chemistry -- the voltages are even the same as those that go through real neurons. The ultimate aim is to create neural networks that exhibit more of the properties of their fleshy equivalents, and they've achieved some degree of success. There's only one synapse so far, but the team has shown that a simulated array of them could accomplish real computing tasks with a high degree of accuracy: the network could recognize handwritten numbers after training on three data sets. The biggest challenge is shrinking the synapse so that it achieves true synapse-like efficiency (they're still using 10,000 times more energy than a real synapse needs to fire). If scientists can get anywhere close to that, though, you could see neural networks that are not only low-power, but are safe enough to interact with real biology -- think AI-driven implants.",ai

Don't tell that to Roland Meertens, though. He recently devised a neural network that turns Game Boy Camera images into more presentable pictures. He trained the AI to clean up, colorize and fill in details for images by feeding it thousands of photos reduced to Game Boy-level image quality. The results aren't exactly good enough to frame for posterity, but they're far easier on the eyes. As is, this is strictly a novelty. It's hard just to find a Game Boy Camera, let alone the companion printer you'll likely need to get images off the system. It's also focused on faces where everything is clearly visible, and has trouble with sideways glances, sunglasses and other However, it isn't hard to see the technology applying to other instances where AI can improve image quality.

However it's used, it's a testament to how far imaging tech has come since the Game Boy Camera's 1998 debut.",ai
Jon Fingas,"It could lead to an earlier, more accurate diagnosis.",2017-02-20T09:36:00-05:00,AI can predict autism through babies' brain scans,"Scientists know that the first signs of autism can appear in early childhood, but reliably predicting that at very young ages is difficult. A behavior questionnaire is a crapshoot at 12 months. However, artificial intelligence might just be the key to making an accurate call. University of North Carolina researchers have developed a deep learning algorithm that can predict autism in babies with a relatively high 81 percent accuracy and 88 percent sensitivity. The team trained the algorithm to recognize early hints of autism by feeding it brain scans and asking it to watch for three common factors: the brain's surface area, its volume and the child's gender (as boys are more likely to have autism). In tests, the AI could spot the telltale increase in surface area as early as 6 months, and a matching increase in volume as soon as 12 months -- it wasn't a surprise that most of these babies were formally diagnosed with autism at 2 years old. As with other uses of AI diagnosis in medicine , the biggest challenge is likely to be producing additional tests that validate and refine the work seen here. The scientists tell IEEE Spectrum that it's difficult to obtain brain scans of babies for use in replication tests, and those scans are often expensive. Also, it likely wouldn't be practical to use this prediction method all the time -- it'd most likely be useful if a test suggests that a baby is at high risk of autism. Even so, the AI could be extremely helpful if it either gives the all-clear or helps parents adjust to the special needs of their child.",ai
Andrew Dalton,Bringing Google to the world just got simpler.,2017-02-16T21:31:00-05:00,Alphabet won't need all those internet balloons after all,"Since it launched nearly four years ago, Alphabet's Project Loon experiment has shifted from an unlikely moonshot to an idea that might actually work. As Alphabet's experimental X division chief and ""Captain of Moonshots"" Astro Teller wrote today , the project team has ""now exceeded even their own expectations,"" in the attempts to build a network of self-navigating, internet-beaming balloons. ""And in the process they've leapt much closer to a day when balloon-powered Internet could become a reality for people in rural and remote regions of the globe."" Back in September, the project's engineers showed how the system learned to ride air currents and stay in place over one area for months at a time. ""The reason this is so exciting,"" Teller elaborated during a press conference at X's Mountain View headquarters, ""is we can now run an experiment and try to give services in particular places of the world with 10 or 20 or 30 balloons, not with 200 or 300 or 400 balloons."" Teller says his team has improved the navigation and altitude control systems to allow for even more precise control, but the AI behind it can get even smarter. It will also need to be tested in other parts of the world to learn how to handle varying conditions, but the implications for the project are very promising. Fewer balloons means operating costs are drastically reduced and service could be deployed to a new region in weeks rather than months -- a huge advantage considering these are meant to deliver internet to remote regions of the world. ""We've actually made so much progress,"" Project Loon engineer Sal Candido said at today's press conference, ""that we think our timeline for when we can provide useful internet service to people is much, much sooner.""",ai
Timothy J. Seppala,"Battling hacks, one AI implementation at a time.",2017-02-16T19:48:00-05:00,Valve may be using a neural net against 'Counter-Strike' cheaters,"It sounds like Valve is taking advantage of a neural network to combat the spread of cheats in Counter-Strike: Global Offensive. Posting on Reddit , someone using the moderator-verified Valve Anti-Cheat account wrote that a fix is in the works for folks using spinbot hacks. A spinbot, as Rock, Paper, Shotgun describes it, helps avoid being hit by other players' weapons. Combined with aiming cheats, it makes the cheater pretty impervious to defeat. But the type of processing power needed to fuel this sort of endeavor sounds pretty intense considering everything that goes on in a given match, and the amount of matches that take place per day. Seems like Valve has this covered, though. ""The process of parsing, training, and classifying player data places serious demands on hardware, which means you want a machine other than the server doing the work. And because you don't know ahead of time who might be using this kind of cheat, you'd have to monitor matches as they take place, from all ten players' perspectives. There are over a million CS:GO matches played every day, so to avoid falling behind you'd need a system capable of parsing and processing every demo of every match from every player's perspective, which currently means you'd need a datacenter capable of powering thousands of cpu cores. The good news is that we've started this work. An early version of the system has already been deployed and is submitting cases to Overwatch. Since the results have been promising, we're going to continue this work and expand the system over time."" It's important to note that Overwatch is the company's system for weeding out cheaters -- not Blizzard's competitive shooter that's taken the world by storm. Considering Valve's work on AI in the past and how much the company values its Steam platform, not to mention Counter-strike itself this all sounds pretty realistic. We've reached out for confirmation that this indeed was a post made by Valve, and will update this post should it arrive. Given the outfit's historic reticence to respond to press inquiries, though, the chances of hearing back may be slim.",ai

Like, say, neural network software that looks at objects through your device's camera and spits rhymes about everyday objects. But they also launch fun tools, like AI Duet , an interactive web-based app that accompanies your piano plinking. Musician Yotam Mann first debuted the app at an event back in November after staying at Google Creative Lab in New York, then open-sourced the code for it. But since it was a bit of a pain to install, the search giant cleaned it up and released it with a simpler web-based interface. On desktop, your home keys activate a slice of the piano's middle notes, while mobile users can tap directly on the screen. It's playful and easy to use, if not totally intuitive about when your AI partner will jump in already. The app runs off Tone.js , an audio library that Mann built himself, but its accompaniment logic is built off Magenta, Google's TensorFlow framework for deep learning. But as Mann tells in the video above, it's not just the AI that's adjusting to humans: As their digital partner riffed new tones off their original notes, folks kept playing to build a simultaneous harmony, creating a continual play loop.

What if you don't have weeks to spare? If Gamalon has its way, you could put AI to work almost immediately. The startup has unveiled a new technique, Bayesian Program Synthesis, that promises AI you can train with just a few samples. The approach uses probabilistic code to fill in gaps in its knowledge. If you show it very short and tall chairs, for example, it should figure out that there are many chair sizes in between. And importantly, it can tweak its own models as it goes along -- you don't need constant human oversight in case circumstances change. Gamalon's technology is already in use, although you probably wouldn't notice. Bloomberg notes that the AI is currently helping companies like Avaya correct ambiguous data like names and addresses within a matter of minutes. However, the fledgling outfit isn't shy about this being used for image recognition and other machine learning tasks.

They might not have to do all the hard work going forward, however. Two sets of researchers have shown that you can teach neural networks to recognize those states and the nature of the transitions themselves. Similar to what you see with other AI-based recognition systems , the networks were trained on images -- in this case, particle collections -- to the point where they could detect phase transitions on their own. They're both very accurate (within 0.3 percent for the temperature of one transition) and only need to see a few hundred atoms to identify what they're looking at. A machine learning system is particularly advantageous in a field like this, as you don't have to outline exactly what you're looking for. You can identify the exact conditions that prompt a transition without knowing what they are, and theoretically spot previously undiscovered transitions. There's a lot of work to be done. It's easy to detect known transitions in a lab, where you can limit the number of particles, but it's much harder when you're looking at the overwhelming volume of particles in real life. If researchers can achieve that feat, though, they could discover reproducible behavior that might be useful in products, such as superconductors with more forgiving properties.",ai

IBM is not only launching Watson for Cybersecurity, a cognitive computing service that parses legions of security reports to extract relevant info, but is unveiling an experimental voice helper to go along with it. Havyn lets digital defense experts ask for threat updates and recommended solutions when it would otherwise be too time-consuming. If security analysts are already hip-deep in work, they don't have to sidetrack themselves with a new research path when Havyn can produce a useful answer in seconds. The combo could be particularly helpful given Watson's depth. The system has studied over 1 million security documents to brush up on the language of security, and it parses reports from sources as diverse as research papers, blogs and incident data. In theory, this cuts the total time for an investigation from days to minutes -- you spend less time interpreting info and more time working with it. Don't expect to see Havyn in widespread use just yet. It's currently in testing with a handful of IBM analysts, and it's only four months old -- it came about when company inventor Mike Spisak and his son decided that sending text commands to Watson was cumbersome. That leaves a lot of room for Havyn to grow, however, and it's easy to imagine the assistant becoming indispensable to security pros who could quickly be overwhelmed if they're not careful.",ai

It's not working for everyone, but people carrying everything from the Nexus 6P to Alcatel's Idol 4S say they've had success. The software has introductory messages that are clearly targeted at people who previously didn't have Assistant, so it's not an accidental inclusion.

Chris Velazco,,2017-02-10T15:25:00-05:00,How an AI took down four world-class poker pros,"""That was anticlimactic,"" Jason Les said with a smirk, getting up from his seat. Unlike nearly everyone else in Pittsburgh's Rivers Casino, Les had just played his last few hands against an artificially intelligent opponent on a computer screen. After his fellow players -- Daniel McAulay next to him and Jimmy Chou and Dong Kim in an office upstairs -- eventually did the same, they started to commiserate. The consensus: That AI was one hell of a player. The four of them had spent the last 20 days playing 120,000 hands of heads-up, no-limit Texas Hold'em against an artificial intelligence called Libratus created by researchers at Carnegie Mellon University. At stake: a total pot of $200,000 and, on some level, the pride of the human race. A similar scene had unfolded two years prior when Les, Kim and two other players decisively laid the smackdown on another AI called Claudico. The players hoped to put on a repeat performance, finish up the event January 30th, and ride the rush of endorphins until they got home and resumed their usual games of online poker. The fight wasn't even close. All told, Libratus won by more than 1.7 million (virtual) dollars, and — just like that — the second Brains vs. AI competition came to a close. To understand what these players were up against and what makes Libratus work, let's go back to a time before all hope of victory was lost. For the four men playing against Libratus, victory didn't always seem impossible. The AI was in the lead from the get-go, building an impressive streak of wins for the first three days. Then came the counter-attack. Day four saw the gap narrow $40,000, and a string of successes on day six brought the humans to within $50,000 of the lead. ""In the start here, we lost the first day,"" Les explained. ""Whatever -- not a big deal. And then we were losing, but then we fought back up to nearly equal. We were feeling really confident! We know how to play, we're going to be able to win."" On the night after the sixth day of competition, the humans did what they did every other night: sift through the Libratus hand data provided to them by CMU in hopes of devising a winning strategy. With spirits high after a big day, they decided on a seemingly crazy strategy: three-betting on every hand that came along. Three-betting, for the uninitiated, is poker slang for reraising on a hand. When you decide to play a hand in a situation like this, paying the blinds is the first bet. If you're confident in your cards, you raise — that's the second bet. Generally, when you reraise — the third bet — you're pretty sure you've got the exchange in the bag. Based on their understanding of Libratus' play style, the humans thought they could knock if off balance by playing this aggressively for a while. It backfired. ""We applied this crazy strategy we would never do online,"" Kim explained. ""Basically, we reraised all of our hands. All of us went in, like, 'Let's just try this, let's go crazy.'"" ""We had a reason to believe that specific size-three-bet was going to work well against the AI,"" Les added. ""We just fired off all day doing that."" Les and Kim concede that they just got unlucky, too, but either way: Libratus was unfazed by their plan and started demolishing them. ""It just kept improving every single day, and we started going backwards and backwards,"" Les said. In fairness, the humans weren't playing with their usual setups. The four competitors are almost exclusively online poker pros, and when duking it out at virtual tables at home, they always have their HUDs handy. These heads-up displays are filled with stats and probabilities that help online players make the best moves. Their absence here in Pittsburgh was noticeable. ""Without the HUD, without the numbers, you don't know if you're being paranoid or not,"" Daniel McAulay said, leaning back in his chair after winning a hand. ""Is it folding less? We were never sure. We would always say the same thing to each other: 'Just play it out until we get home and we'd see the sample of hands and then we'll change the plan. But that cost us a lot of money. A lot of money."" Those losses would only continue to mount. One of the men responsible for the players' anguish can usually be found in his ninth-floor office, overlooking Carnegie Mellon University's snow-flecked quad. Professor Tuomas Sandholm might live a second life as a startup entrepreneur, but he has spent years trying to perfect the algorithms that make Libratus such a potent player. It wasn't out of any particular love for the game -- Sandholm admits he's no poker pro -- but he was fascinated by the thought of complex computer systems that make decisions better than we can. That fixation led him to co-create Claudico (the earlier AI that the humans trounced) with pHD student Noam Brown , and it led the two of them to try again with Libratus. To think of Libratus as just a poker-playing champ is to sorely underestimate it. Instead, Sandholm says, it's a more general set of algorithms meant to tackle any information-imperfect situation. Confused? Don't be. Broadly speaking, the term just describes any situation in which two or more parties don't have the same information. Something unlike, say, chess, where the entirety of the game's world is splayed out on the board in front of players. Those players can figure out exactly what's going on and, assuming they have decent memories, draw on their understanding of the events that led them there. This is a perfect information game. No-limit Texas Hold'em is different. You don't know which cards your opponent has, your opponent doesn't know which cards you have, and those minutes playing a hand to its conclusion are spent trying to make the smartest moves possible with a shortage of intel. And unlike the limit variant, where there's a cap on how big your bets can be, no-limit gives you the freedom to bet whatever you want. There's so much information a person — or an AI — can infer about an opponent's strategy based on their bets that it's no wonder researchers have been trying to crack the game. ""Heads-up, no-limit Texas Hold'em poker has emerged as the leading benchmark for measuring the quality of these general purpose algorithms in the AI community,"" Sandholm told me. With that in mind, Sandholm and Brown jointly built Libratus from three major components. The first is an algorithm that devises overall strategies based on Nash equilibria. In other words, Libratus spent a total of 15 million computing hours chewing on the rules of the game before the competition, finding rational ways to act when both players are making the best possible moves with the information available. Thanks to a new logic model developed by the two researchers to minimize Libratus' ""regret,"" the AI could solve larger abstractions of the game faster and with higher accuracy than before. The second is what Sandholm calls the end-game solver. This is the part that players actually faced during their 20 days of combat. Unsurprisingly, too, this is where Sandholm says most innovative breakthroughs have happened. Essentially, this allowed Libratus to cook up an approach based on the first two cards it was dealt, and modify that approach based on its opponent's actions and the river and flop that are dealt. Sandholm says Libratus was also designed to keep tabs on how safe its options are. Let's say a human player screws up and loses $372. That money is viewed as a gift of sorts, so the AI can freely lose up to $372 and still remain ahead. ""That gives us more flexibility for optimizing our strategies while still being safe,"" Sandholm explained. We'll get to the last key component a little later. In any case, the sheer number of complex calculations meant Libratus couldn't run on the desktop in Sandholm's office. If nothing else, the human players can take solace in the fact that it took a supercomputer and millions of computing hours to beat them. If you thought Go was tough to wrap your head around, consider the complexity of no-limit Texas Hold'em: When you're dealt into a game, the hands you're dealt and the communal cards that appear are one possibility of 10^160. ""That's one followed by 160 zeroes,"" said Sandholm. ""That's more than the number of atoms in the universe. You cannot just brute-force your way through it."" Still, it takes some degree of brute force to build as close to optimal a strategy as possible. That's where ""Bridges"" comes in. If Libratus is the brain of the operation, Bridges -- a supercomputer made of hundreds of nodes in the basement of the Pittsburgh Supercomputing Center -- is most definitely the brawn. ""Libratus is running on about 600 nodes at Bridges, out of 846 total compute nodes,"" said Nick Nystrom , senior director of research at the Pittsburgh Supercomputing Center. Most of those 800+ nodes have two CPUs, each with 28 computing cores and 128GB of RAM. Forty-eight of those nodes have two state-of-the-art GPUs, and still others were loaded with even more power: NVIDIA's Tesla-series K80 and P100 GPUs. There's more: 42 of those nodes have 3TB of RAM each, and a very special four nodes have a whopping 12TB of RAM. That's some serious firepower, but all those nodes were ingeniously woven together to maximize data bandwidth and minimize latency. It's just as well, considering the amount of data involved: Libratus was using up to 2.6 petabytes of storage during the competition. When not being used to best humans at card games, Bridges was being used for around 650 projects by more than 2,500 people. Think of Bridges as a supercomputer for hire: Researchers from around the country are using it to gain insight into arcane subjects like genomics, genome-sequence assemblies and other kinds of machine-learning. The beauty of Bridges, according to Nystrom, is that those researchers don't need to be supercomputer buffs. ""It's a very cloud-like model letting people who are not programmers, not computer scientists, not supercomputer users make use of a supercomputer without necessarily even knowing it."" That's what happened with Libratus, and everything seemed to be working perfectly. After the humans' gutsy attack plan failed, Libratus spent the rest of the competition inflating its virtual winnings. When the game lurched into its third week, the AI was up by a cool $750,000. Victory was assured, but the humans were feeling worn out. When I chatted with Kim and Les in their hotel bar after the penultimate day's play, the mood was understandably somber. ""Yesterday, I think, I played really bad,"" Kim said, rubbing his eyes. ""I was pretty upset, and I made a lot of big mistakes. I was pretty frustrated. Today, I cut that deficit in half, but it's still probably unlike for me to win."" At this point, with so little time left and such a large gap to close, their plan was to blitz through the remaining hands and complete the task in front of them. For these world-class players, beating Libratus had gone from being a real possibility to a pipe dream in just a matter of days. It was obvious that the AI was getting better at the game over time, sometimes by leaps and bounds that left Les, Kim, McAulay and Chou flummoxed. It wasn't long before the pet theories began to surface. Some thought Libratus might have been playing completely differently against each of them, and others suspected the AI was adapting to their play styles while they were playing. They were wrong. As it turned out, they weren't the only ones looking back at the past day's events to concoct a game plan for the days to come. Every night, after the players had retreated to their hotel rooms to strategize, the basement of the Supercomputing Center continued to thrum. Libratus was busy. Many of us watching the events unfold assumed the AI was spending its compute cycles figuring out ways to counter the players' individual play styles and fight back, but Professor Sandholm was quick to rebut that idea. Libratus isn't designed to find better ways to attack its opponents; it's designed to constantly fortify its defenses. Remember those major Libratus components I mentioned? This is the last, and perhaps most important, one. ""All the time in the background, the algorithm looks at what holes the opponents have found in our strategy and how often they have played those,"" Sandholm told me. ""It will prioritize the holes and then compute better strategies for those parts, and we have a way of automatically gluing those fixes into the base strategy."" If the humans leaned on a particular strategy -- like their constant three-bets -- Libratus could theoretically take some big losses. The reason those attacks never ended in sustained victory is because Libratus was quietly patching those holes by using the supercomputer in the background. The Great Wall of Libratus was only one reason the AI managed to pull so far ahead. Sandholm refers to Libratus as a ""balanced"" player that uses randomized actions to remain inscrutable to human competitors. More interesting, though, is how good Libratus was at finding rare edge cases in which seemingly bad moves were actually excellent ones. ""It plays these weird bet sizes that are typically considered really bad moves,"" Sandholm explained. These include tiny underbets, like 10 percent of the pot, or huge overbets, like 20 times the pot. Donk betting, limping -- all sorts of strategies that are, according to the poker books and folk wisdom, bad strategies."" To the players' shock and dismay, those ""bad strategies"" worked all too well. On the afternoon of January 30th, Libratus officially won the second Brains vs AI competition. The final margin of victory: $1,766,250. Each of the players divvied up their $200,000 spoils (Dong Kim lost the least amount of money to Libratus, earning about $75,000 for his efforts), fielded questions from reporters and eventually left to decompress. Not much had gone their way over the past 20 days, but they just might have contributed to a more thoughtful, AI-driven future without even realizing it. Through Libratus, Sandholm had proved algorithms could make better, more-nuanced decisions than humans in one specific realm. But remember: Libratus and systems like it are general-purpose intelligences, and Sandholm sees plenty of potential applications. As an entrepreneur and negotiation buff, he's enthusiastic about algorithms like Libratus being used for bargaining and auctions. ""When the FCC auctions spectrum licenses, they sell tens of billions of dollars of spectrum per auction, yet nobody knows even one rational way of bidding,"" he said. ""Wouldn't it be nice if you had some AI support?"" But there are bigger problems to tackle — ones that could affect all of us more directly. Sandholm pointed to developments in cybersecurity, military settings and finance. And, of course, there's medicine. ""In a new project, we're steering evolution and biological adaptation to battle viral and bacterial infections,"" he said. ""Think of the infection as the opponent and you're taking sequential actions and measurements just like in a game."" Sandholm also pointed out that such algorithms could even be used to more helpfully manage diseases like cancer, both by optimizing the use of existing treatment methods and maybe even developing new ones. Jason, Dong, Daniel and Jimmy might have lost this prolonged poker showdown, but what Sandholm, Brown and their contemporaries have learned in the process could lead to some big wins for humanity.",ai

In its research blog , Google explained that the feature uses on-device machine intelligence, so it works even if you don't have an internet cloud connection. While the researchers initially thought doing that would be impossible, the ""Expander"" AI team saw it as a unique opportunity. ""[We] returned to the drawing board to design a completely new, lightweight, machine learning architecture -- not only to enable Smart Reply on Android Wear, but also to power a wealth of other on-device mobile applications,"" the team wrote. It tried using current neural net tech and so-called graph learning, but the models didn't fit on a smartwatch and attempts to limit the number of replies ""did not produce useful results,"" they wrote. In an attempt to make it more compact, the researchers built a simpler system that groups messages requiring a similar responses, like ""Hey, how's it going?"" and ""How's it going buddy,"" rapidly and with a low memory hit. From there, it uses ""semi-supervised graph learning"" that checks your replies to messages, word and phrase similarity and other factors to predict the best possible replies. The entire model, including the training, resides and performs ""completely on device,"" the team notes. ""The model can also be adapted to cater to the user's writing style and individual preferences to provide a personal experience."" The researchers were surprised at how well it works on Android Wear devices, which aren't renowned as computing powerhouses, and plans to use the AI algorithms behind it to ""enable completely new applications in the months to come.""

Andrew Tarantola,They're developing tech to review police body cam footage in real time,2017-02-09T12:43:00-05:00,Taser bought two computer vision AI companies,"Law enforcement agencies across the country are adopting body-worn cameras as a means both of increasing their transparency with the public and generating actionable feedback to improve officer performance. Problem is, all these body cams produce terabytes of data daily, far more than many departments can effectively handle. That's why Taser (yes those guys, they make body cameras too) announced on Thursday that it has acquired a pair of companies that specialize in computer- and machine-vision to create the ""Axon AI"" group. Together, they'll develop a platform that can efficiently parse this flood of data in real time. The Axon AI group will include about 20 programmers and engineers. They'll be tasked with developing AI capabilities specifically for public safety and law enforcement. The backbone of the Axon AI platform comes from Dextro Inc. Their computer-vision and deep learning system can search the visual contents of a video feed in real time. The Fossil Group team, which Taser also acquired, will support Dextro's search capability by ""improving the accuracy, efficiency and speed of processing images and video,"" according to the company's press release. The AI platform is the latest addition to Taser's Axon ecosystem , which include everything from body and dash cameras to evidence and interview logging. Altogether the Axon system handles 5.2 petabytes of data from more than half of the nation's major city police departments. With the new AI system in place, law enforcement could finally get a handle on all that footage. ""Axon AI will greatly reduce the time spent preparing videos for public information requests or court submission,"" Taser CEO, Rick Smith, said in a statement. ""This will lay the foundation for a future system where records are seamlessly recorded by sensors rather than arduously written by police officers overburdened by paperwork.""",ai
Nick Summers,"Depending on the rules, AI will help or turn on each other.",2017-02-09T12:25:00-05:00,DeepMind is using games to test AI aggression and cooperation,"As our ability to create AI grows, it's important that we assess how it behaves in different situations. DeepMind, Google's AI division in London, has been concerned with one aspect in particular: what happens when two or more AI have similar or conflicting goals. The team wanted a test similar to the "" Prisoner's Dilemma ,"" a popular game that pits two suspects against one another. In this scenario, you're given a choice: testify against the other person and you'll go free, while they have to serve three years. If you both say yes independently, however, you'll serve two years in jail. It's a dilemma without a simple answer. To test its AI agents, DeepMind developed two new games, called Gathering and Wolfpack. In Gathering, two colored squares are tasked with picking up ""apples"" in the middle of the screen. They can also fire a laser which, if accurate, removes the other character from the game temporarily. How co-operative or combative would they be? Unsurprisingly, the pair was quite peaceful at the start, collecting apples at a steady pace. As the fruit pile dwindled, however, they learned to become more aggressive and fire their laser at each other. Like Prisoner's Dilemma, the agents have to decide whether to ""defect"" and attack the other player. Curiously, they would become more hostile as their computational power was increased. The rate of firing would go up regardless of how many apples were left on screen too. The reason why is simple: aiming is complicated. It involves timing and tracking the other agent's movement. Ignoring their behavior and simply seeking apples is an easier, but potentially slower route to success. As a result, the AI with lower cognitive capacity would tend to fall back on this basic strategy. Wolfpack is a little different. It challenges two agents to co-operate in finding a third, fleeing piece of AI. Blocky obstacles are littered on the screen, so the teammates have to figure out when to flank and corner their opponent. DeepMind noted that here, higher cognitive capacity lent to more cooperation between the agents. That's in contrast to Gathering, which produced more conflicts when the 'smarts' were increased. The differing results highlight the importance of intelligence, but also the game and its underlying ruleset. AI will behave differently depending on the task at hand and what's required to be victorious. The findings are important as humanity releases multiple AI into the world. It's likely some will clash and try to either co-operate or sabotage one another. What happens, for instance, if an AI is managing traffic flow across the city, while another is trying to reduce carbon emissions in the state? The rules of the ""game"" which govern their behavior then become vital. Setting parameters, and being mindful of other agents, will be crucial if we're to balance the global economy, public health and climate change.",ai
Jon Fingas,'Blade Runner' style image enhancement is just a neural network away.,2017-02-07T14:20:00-05:00,Google uses AI to sharpen low-res images,"Deckard's photo-enhancing gear in Blade Runner is still the stuff of fantasy. However, Google might just have a close-enough approximation before long. The Google Brain team has developed a system that uses neural networks to fill in the details on very low-resolution images. One of the networks is a ""conditioning"" element that maps the lower-res shot to similar higher-res examples to get a basic idea of what the image should look like. The other, the ""prior"" network, models sharper details to make the final result more plausible. The results are far from perfect, but can frequently come close to the real deal. A virtually unusable 8-pixel by 8-pixel portrait suddenly has recognizable facial features, for instance. And even in those moments where the AI system gets many details wrong, it's frequently close enough that you'll at least have an inkling of what's there. An indistinguishable blob might become clear enough to tell that it's a bedroom. As for potential uses? Google+ ( on some Android phones ) is already using a similar implementation for image compression. Police wouldn't want to use Google's technology to definitively identify a suspect (not in its current state, at least), but it could help validate hunches that their suspect was present in the background of a shot. This might also be useful for cleaning up tiny details in photos when they're blown up to larger sizes. It might not be strictly accurate, but it would be more presentable.",ai

They're about to get a helping hand, though. IBM is partnering with H&R Block to make Watson a part of the tax filing process at locations across the US starting on February 6th. After you participate in an initial interview, the artificial intelligence will offer suggestions to Tax Pros (read: experts) looking for deductions, and illustrate the bigger picture for you on a dedicated client screen. Ideally, Watson's ability to understand context and intent will turn your statements into tangible data that leads to bigger tax breaks. This doesn't guarantee that Watson will find dramatic savings. It's dependent on your input, so it won't know to go looking for deductions if you haven't at least suggested something. This is more about eliminating omissions (say, due to changes in tax law) and streamlining the experience than it is exploiting obscure parts of the tax code. Having said this, the team-up is still in its ""first phase."" H&R Block hopes to use Watson in other areas of its business, and the cognitive computing system should improve as it masters the nuances of the tax system.

Chris Velazco,"Sorry, fellow humans: It wasn't even close.",2017-01-31T09:46:00-05:00,"Libratus, the poker-playing AI, destroyed its four human rivals","The Kenny Rogers classic profoundly states that ""you've got to know when to hold 'em, know when to fold 'em,"" and for the first time, an AI has out-gambled world-class players at heads-up, no-limit Texas Hold'em. Our representatives of humanity -- Jason Les, Dong Kyu Kim, Daniel McAulay and Jimmy Chou -- kept things relatively tight at the outset but a ill-fated shift in strategy wiped out their gains and forced them to chase the AI for the remaining weeks. At the end of day 20 and after 120,000 hands, Libratus claimed victory with daily total of $206,061 in theoretical chips and an overall pile of $1,766,250. ""I think the worst result for the human team here would've been us showing up and losing and walking away thinking we could've done more, having some sort of regret,"" said Jason Les, who came in fourth. CMU was quick to assure the team, though, that they had indeed given Libratus the best possible run for its (virtual) money. ""This is a landmark step for AI,"" said Libratus co-creator and Carnegie Mellon University professor Tuomas Sandholm in an email. ""This is the first time that AI has been able to beat the best humans at Heads-Up No-Limit Texas Hold'em. More generally, this shows that the best AI's ability to do strategic reasoning under imperfect information has surpassed that of the best humans."" The two key words in the good professor's statement are ""imperfect information"". Libratus wasn't designed specifically to beat poker (and for that matter, the insanely high-powered computers Libratus actually runs on aren't built for that either). Instead, Libratus at its core is a series of algorithms co-developed by Sandholm and pHD candidate Noam Brown that can interpret the rules and constraints of a certain situation and figure out a strategy when it doesn't know what the other party knows. Consider games like chess and go: if you pay enough attention, you can relatively easily understand the world of the game and the how particular board positions came to be. You'll never have that kind of understanding when playing a few hands of no-limit Hold'em, which has made it a big target for AI researchers. Speaking of, we have to wonder how a rival team of researchers from the University of Alberta and two Czech schools are reacting to the news -- they claimed their own DeepStack AI was the first to beat high-level poker players, but the identities of the AI's foes were never publicly disclosed. For what's worth, none of the humans embroiled in this defeat feel too upset about it. The amount of money spent and computing power required to beat them was impressive, to say the least, and it doesn't hurt that the contenders get to split a $200,000 prize pot based on how well they stacked up against Libratus. While tired -- they spent plenty of late nights poring over data and strategizing -- none of them plans to take much of a break. Meanwhile, Sandholm and Brown have their work cut out for them, too: they'll spend the next weeks and months prepping all of Libratus's data for publication.

New Scientist notes that a London firm, StatusToday, recently joined a security accelerator run by the UK's GCHQ intelligence agency. The company's AI uses metadata from your workplace habits (such as the files you access and when you unlock doors) to spot unusual behavior as it happens. If you suddenly download a lot of data or venture into a part of the office you never frequent, the AI can alert the company and ask you what's going on. For GCHQ, the use case would be obvious: it wants to prevent spies and whistleblowers from making off with valuable secrets. It would also be helpful at organizations of all kinds worried that ex-employees might take data on their way out. However, it also raises serious privacy concerns, especially since it can also be used to track productivity. Management could know if you visited a friend in another department, for instance, or accuse you of slacking off if you aren't following your usual work patterns. This isn't automatically a problem. The main question is permission: do you agree to AI tracking? It's one thing if you know about monitoring when you apply for the job, but it's another if your employer decides to snoop without telling anyone. Companies also need to explain just what they're doing, so you aren't left worrying about the conditions that set off an AI alert.

The board is scheduled to meet for the first in early February and we expect to bear more details shortly after. Apple pledged to share some of its AI work in early December before publishing the aforementioned paper a few days later. The typically secretive company showed signs of opening up in the name of improving research efforts around machine learning. That was the latest in a string of recent AI-related moves for Apple as it acquired Seattle-based machine-learning company Turi back in August. In October, it hired Carnegie Mellon computer science professor Russ Salakhutdinov to lead its artificial intelligence research.",ai
Jon Fingas,The deep learning algorithm could eventually give you a diagnosis at home.,2017-01-26T00:04:00-05:00,AI is nearly as good as humans at identifying skin cancer,"If you're worried about the possibility of skin cancer , you might not have to depend solely on the keen eye of a dermatologist to spot signs of trouble. Stanford researchers (including tech luminary Sebastian Thrun ) have discovered that a deep learning algorithm is about as effective as humans at identifying skin cancer. By training an existing Google image recognition algorithm using over 130,000 photos of skin lesions representing 2,000 diseases, the team made an AI system that could detect both different cancers and benign lesions with uncanny accuracy. In early tests, its performance was ""at least"" 91 percent as good as a hypothetically flawless system. The algorithm would have to be refined and rigorously tested before put to use in the medical world. You don't want a glitch leading to the wrong diagnosis. If and when it's ready for prime time, however, it could do more than save time when you're at the clinic. Ideally, you could use the algorithm on your smartphone -- imagine taking a photo of an unusual mark on your body and getting an initial verdict without leaving home. And since you can train computer vision systems to recognize many object types, you could theoretically apply the technology to other visible conditions.",ai

Jamie Rigg,The organization is writing new rules to stop AI tools giving players an advantage.,2017-01-20T13:07:00-05:00,Korean Go body to ban smartphones thanks to Google's AI,"South Korean Go players will be banned from using smartphones during official tournaments in the future, and it's all thanks to Google's AlphaGo AI. The Korea Times reports that the Korea Baduk Association -- baduk being the local name for Go -- is currently drafting new rules that will outlaw smartphone use in matches. While the organization is fully aware you can't carry AlphaGo around in your pocket at the moment, it's preempting a time when certain AI tools that can give players a competitive edge do become available on smartphones. It may seem strange that smartphone use is permitted in official Go competitions as it stands, but then there's basically no precedent for digital tools being of any help to experienced players. Though IBM's Deep Blue chess computer beat world champ Garry Kasparov in 1997, the number of variables and strategic complexity of Go have kept programmers from creating bots that exhibit anything more than an amateur skill level. This all changed with AlphaGo, an AI developed by Google's DeepMind team that uses a neural network for a more human-like approach to problem solving. Last year, AlphaGo claimed a historic 4-1 victory over grandmaster Lee Sedol; and, more recently, a newer prototype version of the AI has been wiping the floor with other top players online. The Korea Baduk Association isn't in any great rush to implement new rules, since AI Go coaches aren't an immediate threat. ""But when it becomes more popular and widespread, we will push ahead with more concrete regulations about the use of smartphones during matches,"" an association official told The Korea Times. It makes sense that the organization would start thinking about how to keep competition pure now, though, instead of having to react to future tools that can give players a leg up.",ai
Steve Dent,The Echo bot can find the 50 latest papers and read you the summaries.,2017-01-19T12:41:00-05:00,"Alexa gets meta, finds you the latest AI research","AI research is so hot right now, it's hard for even scientists in the field to keep up. To stay on top of the 300-plus papers submitted per day to Arxiv.org , machine-learning researcher Amine Ben Khalifa naturally turned to... machine learning. He taught Amazon's AI-powered Alexa bot to find the latest AI research papers for the day, read the titles and give a summary of specific projects, all via voice control. ""Alexa changed the way I get my daily flash briefings,"" Khalifa said. ""With the arxivML Alexa skill, I intend to skip paper browsing altogether, and instead get paper briefings while getting ready to go to work."" After it's asked, as shown in the video below, Alexa reads the top 50 papers of the day related to machine learning, AI and similar topics. If you want to know more about one of them, it'll then read the abstract, and you can stop it anytime, or say ""Alexa, next"" to skip to the next title. The app also shows titles and abstracts in the Alexa app to help you keep track of where it is. Staying on top of the latest work is a must for machine learning researchers, Khalifa notes, and using Alexa is a pretty apt way to do that. (If you'd rather read about the latest AI work, there's also the "" Arxiv Sanity Preserver "" from AI researcher Andrej Karpathy.) The arxivML Alexa skill is available to anyone who wants it on Amazon's Skill Store , and in the spirit of the field, Khalifa also posted the code on GitHub for anyone who wants to tweak it.",ai

Previously at Microsoft and Yahoo (and an authority in artificial intelligence), Dr. Qi Lu might be just what the company needs. Baidu's profits have slipped from parts of its internet business and Lu will help lead Baidu's efforts in AI, which already include a smartphone assistant and self-driving cars. The company is already using AI to match advertisers with customers online, but has find new ways to grow after new advertising regulations in China hit its ad business hard. It still dominates China's internet search , where it holds an 80 percent market share. In comparison, Google claims just 64% of the US' web searches. Tech giant Alibaba is also starting to tap into search and ads. Dr. Lu will join Andrew Ng, a former Google executive who founded the company's artificial-intelligence unit. In a press release, Baidu said that AI was a ""key strategic focus for the next decade"". Last year, the company launched a $200 million fund to focus on AI, augmented reality and deep learning. Baidu has also announced that it will work with mapping company Here to expand its maps into Europe and further. It also opened an augmented reality research lab in Beijing, and is already working with the likes of BMW, KFC and L'Oreal. Including Lu's hiring announcement, all three announcements were made in the last 24 hours. The company has already forecasted a 4.5 percent dip in revenue for the last quarter -- its full-year earnings report should land next month.

Devindra Hardawar,But that won't stop AI from eventually hurting jobs.,2017-01-16T14:10:00-05:00,"Microsoft CEO says AI should help, not replace, workers","Artificial intelligence has gone from being something relegated to science fiction, to a buzzword every tech company is eager to slap onto their latest innovations. When it comes to the implementation of AI, though, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella is urging for companies to take a considerate approach. ""The fundamental need of every person is to be able to use their time more effectively, not to say, 'let us replace you',"" he said at the DLD conference in Munich, according to Bloomberg. While acknowledging that AI will be democratized quite a bit this year, Nadella noted, ""The most exciting thing to me is not just our own promise of AI as exhibited by these products, but to take that capability and put it in the hands of every developer and every organization."" The notion goes back to his revised mission statement for Microsoft to ""empower every person and every organization on the planet to achieve more."" It's nice to see a CEO take a more humanistic approach to fancy new technologies for once. But it's also hard to deny that even a light approach to AI could eventually lead to stronger implementations that could end up replacing human employees. That'll be even more pronounced as artificial intelligence is applied to automation, something that's already hurting manufacturing jobs (while increasing productivity for companies). As we've pointed out, technology could end up replacing retail jobs soon , similar to what we've seen with the Amazon Go concept store.",ai
Aaron Souppouris,"Memories made, not saved.",2017-01-12T14:00:00-05:00,An AI camera failed to capture the magic of CES,"Relonch wanted me to fall in love with photography again this CES. But its camera is so radically different from everything I've used before that I struggled to put my faith in its promise. The company is based in Palo Alto, California, and its pitch is simple, if very Silicon Valley: a camera as a service. You hand in your old shooter (yes, really) and in return you get the 291 , a unique, leather-bound DLSR-shaped camera. It has an APS-C sensor; a fixed, 45mm-equivalent lens; an electronic viewfinder; a shutter key; and, importantly, a 4G radio inside. The 291 uses that radio to send raw files to Relonch's servers. Once they're there, AI scans through your shots and picks the best ones. To do this, it identifies the individual elements in the photos using computer vision and judges your composition. It'll then process the raws, individually lighting and coloring elements before applying its own crop and sending them back as JPEGs. You receive a batch of photos each morning, which is key to Relonch's business model. The idea is you choose the photos you love as part of your morning ritual, which reminds you to take your camera out again and keep snapping. The 291 itself is free. The photos are sent to you as small, watermarked files, and you have the option to keep them, which grants access to the full-size file (as large as 20 megapixels, depending on how the AI has decided to crop it). Each photo you keep costs $1, and you start your account with the market value of the camera you handed in as credit. Oh, and if you decide you want to pick a photo at a later date, you can always go back and buy it. Likewise, if you don't like the 291, you can hand it back in exchange for your old camera. That financial proposition is what intrigues me most. Over the past five years I've spent $3,000 or so on various cameras and lenses. I've probably processed and kept maybe 300 photos, outside of work. (Of course, there are another 30,000 or so that are gathering digital dust on various SD cards and hard drives.) I picked up my 291 the day before CES was set to begin, briefly meeting with Relonch co-founder Yuriy Motin, who explained the process. After, I headed out for a meal with a few colleagues at a pretty bad Las Vegas eatery and snapped away. Using the 291 might feel natural to those used to a point-and-shoot or smartphone camera, but for someone accustomed to aperture rings and settings dials, it was disorienting. There's no way to zoom or manually focus and no way to check on ISO or aperture. This is intentional, of course, as Relonch believes its AI can balance the photos and doesn't want people distracted by such things. When coupled with the lack of screen, though, it introduces an uncertainty to proceedings. The following morning, I received 15 photos via the Relonch site and went through them one by one, deciding (in Relonch's parlance) which were Remarkable and Not Remarkable. I ended with eight, at a value of $8. Were I not using the 291 for work, probably only a couple of them would have made the grade, but I was conscious of my need to have a decent bank of photos by the end of the week. The photos were generally OK. I was impressed with the way the AI processed a chance meeting of Engadget and Verge editors, which was taken in darkness but exposed well. Yes, it's noisy and it's not going to win any awards, but it was a photo I wanted (I've worked for both sites) and I'm glad it panned out that way. Others taken at and around the restaurant were generally good, although I didn't appreciate the weird square crop on the photo of Nate (Ingraham) and Jess (Conditt). My plan was to continue to shoot for a couple more days and document the results. Like all best-laid plans it quickly went awry, but that wasn't entirely Relonch's fault. I spent most of day two in our trailer, frantically writing up an article with a tight deadline. As such, I'd only taken a couple of photos by 3 PM. As I jumped on a bus to Faraday Future's FF91 launch event, that thought was weighing heavy on my mind. So much so that I ended up snapping a shot of the Vegas sunset out of the bus' dirty, UV-filtered window, which is not something I'd usually do. (I am very much about portraits rather than landscapes.) By the time I reached the venue (which was held in a tent across town from our CES trailer), the sun had set, and I was in panic mode. I quickly grabbed an exterior shot and headed inside to find interesting subjects while still attempting to do my regular job. Ironically, my job that night was to support our auto expert Roberto Baldwin by taking photos of Faraday's new car, but I couldn't use the 291 because I had to publish them the same day. Not for the last time this week, I had to bring a second camera along. After I was finished with work shooting, I took a few photos of some prototypes, a couple of my colleague Robbie and then some of the maelstrom that followed the event. The next morning, I received almost nothing but disappointment: There were precious few photos worth keeping from the event. Some of that can be blamed on lighting conditions or a last-second shake of the hand, but I'd captured some nice images at the event for Engadget and was surprised at the lack of quality photos from the Relonch. A lot of the images were just... unnatural looking. Like someone had used an aggressive Instagram filter or a cheap ""HDR"" application. I chose to keep two photos of Robbie (above), to highlight the difference between the AI's processing choices. Other images were better, and the sunset shot actually came out OK, if a little too saturated for my tastes. On my final day with the 291, CES struck again. I attended a briefing with Razer for the Ariana projector and Valerie laptop, which I didn't want to take the camera to. The meeting was under a timed nondisclosure agreement, and, although I'm probably overcautious, I was worried about randomly sending photos of secret prototypes across the internet. After the briefing, I sat inside the trailer processing the images I took for work and writing up other articles. Then, 3 PM came again. I'd taken no photos with the 291 and needed to rush across town to an ASUS media suite, where I'd be taking photos of the company's new Zenfone AR. Again, I brought my personal camera as I'd need the images quickly, but once I was done with work, I hung around the periphery for 10 minutes, waiting for the video shoot to wrap. I used the opportunity to take a few snaps with the 291 before traveling to an NVIDIA keynote that involved writing and taking photos of NVIDIA things and then to a live show where I met with people and also didn't take any photos. I woke the next day to four thoroughly unremarkable shots in my Relonch photo box. I'm not a professional photographer but I do take a lot of photographs, and I'm confident enough that it's the camera, not me, at fault here. At the ASUS Zenfone AR shoot, lighting conditions were fantastic. On my personal camera, I was typically shooting at 1/160th of a second with ISO set to 640 and f/2.0 aperture. Why, or how, had the 291 failed under these conditions? I'm not entirely sure. The photos I received from Relonch were all either fuzzy or blurred. They weren't massively noisy, but they also weren't anywhere near sharp. Relonch photos don't have any metadata, so I can't tell what the settings were, but for an almost stationary subject to be blurred, it must have been shooting at a very slow shutter speed, which makes absolutely no sense given the lighting in the space. Relonch's business plan makes a lot of sense to me. I love how passionate the company's founders are about photography, and I love the concept of an AI delivering me perfectly edited photographs every morning. I love the pitch that my life might be as photogenic as anyone else's, if I only took my camera to capture it. But I don't love the 291. The 291 feels nice. It looks striking. But inside its leather-bound case lies a very average camera. The hardware package feels equivalent to entry-level DSLRs but without Nikon's or Canon's optical know-how and handling or the ability to switch lenses. To make matters worse, its software is clearly imperfect. The camera doesn't appear to be making the right decisions with regards to shutter speed, focus and aperture, and the helpful AI autoprocessing is inconsistent and sometimes too aggressive. Part of Relonch's pitch is that you always have your camera with you, capturing everyday moments. When I collected the 291 from him, Relonch's Motin pointed to White House photographer Pete Souza, noting that the best shots of Barack Obama are the candid ones taken between big events. My CES was full of such moments. I met with colleagues and old friends, people who I see at most once a year. I made new friends and had memorable conversations. I watched two colleagues embody Elsa, if only for five minutes. Between the stress and exhaustion, I laughed, a lot. But after a couple days, I didn't trust the 291 to capture those moments. A camera as a service remains a truly interesting proposition, though. It was probably unreasonable to hope that Relonch had nailed it on its first attempt, just as it was unreasonable to pick my busiest week of the year to test the 291. Assuming it has the funding to continue pursuing its dream, Relonch still has my attention. Its AI will only get better, as, I'm sure, will the 291. Early testers are apparently happy with the 291, and Relonch says its algorithms will improve, learning from everyone who uses its cameras. The 291 is in a limited launch, and Relonch is currently only accepting photographers into the program who meet its criteria. I will definitely try one of the company's cameras again, this time carrying it around my home city, without the pressure of a trade show, and I'm truly excited to see if the company can make this business model work. I'd also consider just using the AI processing, if the company is able to perfect it and offer that as a stand-alone service. (It's not in the company's immediate plans.) So many of the photos I take are left untouched, taking up needless space on my laptop, purely because I don't have the time or inclination to process the raw files. Relonch could be onto something here, but it has to improve its software to have a hope at succeeding. Click here to catch up on the latest news from CES 2017.",ai
Chris Velazco,Also on deck: the mid-range HTC U Play.,2017-01-12T03:30:00-05:00,HTC's 'U Ultra' flagship phone pairs AI with a secondary screen,"Last year, HTC's flagship ""10"" smartphone won plenty of accolades. Engadget, for its part, liked the phone because the company eschewed gimmicks in favor of an excellent no-nonsense device. With a new year comes a new flagship, though, and this time HTC is taking a different approach. Meet the HTC U Ultra, a peculiar little machine that should seem familiar to fans of other high-end smartphones. When we say ""familiar,"" though, we're not talking about the phone's design and materials. In fact, the U Ultra's exterior is unlike anything else in recent memory. Some of HTC's usual design flourishes, such as the pill-shaped fingerprint sensor and the centered UltraPixel camera, are still here, but the company's designers traded the usual aluminum look for a finish that seems almost liquid. The frame is still made of metal, but the back is covered with a beautiful curved glass that looks almost pearlescent under the right light. It's a gorgeous effect born from HTC's obsession with material science that plays well on all four of the U Ultra's colors (black, white, blue and pink). And beyond all that, it feels pretty great in-hand too, in part thanks to a sleek profile measuring just under 8mm at its thickest point. While you might notice those finishes first, it's the screen that makes the U Ultra feel more like an LG phone. Well, the second screen, to be more precise: It sits above the Ultra's 5.7-inch Quad HD Super LCD 5 display just like it did on the LG V10 and V20. Sure enough, you'll be able to add shortcuts to apps and get weather readouts, but HTC is counting on artificial intelligence to actually make that second screen useful. Contrast that with devices such as the V20, where notifications appear as events occur, ultimately leading to a list sorted by time rather than importance. Not so on the U Ultra. It only displays notifications from people it thinks you want to hear from, though that requires some initial setup. Darren Sng, HTC's head of global product marketing, laid out situations where the phone would try to be proactive. Let's say there's rain in the forecast today: The so-called Sense Companion will warn you on that second screen before you leave the house. And if a holiday rolls around and you don't have any pressing events in your calendar, the assistant will shut off previously set alarms. (That last one sounds a little dicey to me, but we'll have to wait and see how well this works over time.) Those machine learning smarts extend beyond that second screen. As with Huawei's Mate 9 , the phone will attempt to suss out underlying patterns in how we use our phones and allocate resources or shut down services in response. And like basically everything else at CES, you can talk to it through an array of microphones. Look closely enough at the U Ultra and you'll spot four of them dotting the body. They're always on and always listening for your voice within a range of about two meters.",ai
Jon Fingas,They want AI to consider social values.,2017-01-11T10:19:00-05:00,eBay and LinkedIn founders back research into ethical AI,"Some big names in the tech world aren't just fretting over the possibility of dangerous AI , they're taking steps to make sure it doesn't happen. LinkedIn founder Reid Hoffman and eBay founder Pierre Omidyar (through his Omidyar Network) are pouring a total of $20 million into a newly created Ethics and Governance of Artificial Intelligence Fund that will fuel research into the social considerations around AI. The organization wants to be sure that machines aren't just guided by ""engineers and corporations"" -- they should consider the input of everyone from social scientists through to economists and politicians. The fund is also getting $5 million from the Knight Foundation, and a total of $2 million between the Raptor Group and the Hewlett Foundation. MIT Media Lab and Harvard University's Berkman Klein Center for Internet & Society will be the first academic institutions conducting studies. The backers acknowledge that there are a lot of factors to consider, and that there won't be any quick solutions. How do you write AI that considers ethics and morals? How do you make it accountable for its actions? And how do you ensure that companies building AI are working in the public interest without stifling their creativity? Someone has to get the ball rolling, though, and it won't be surprising if the fund helps influence technology for a long while.",ai
Chris Velazco,The game: No-limit Texas hold'em. The stakes: Human pride.,2017-01-10T16:25:00-05:00,Two research teams taught their AIs to beat pros at poker,"Poker-playing bots aren't exactly new -- just ask anyone who's tried to win a little cash on PokerStars -- but two different groups of researchers are setting their sights a little higher. To no one's surprise, those AI buffs are trying to teach their algorithms how to beat world-class Texas Hold'em players, and they're juuuust about there. In a paper ( PDF ) published on January 6, a team of collaborators from the University of Alberta , Charles University and the Czech Technical University claimed that their DeepStack AI is the ""the first computer program to beat professional poker players in heads-up no-limit Texas hold'em"". That confident (but not yet peer-reviewed) proclamation on the heels of a string of victories against high-level human players -- in total, 44,852 hands were played against 33 players recruited by the International Federation of Poker. Well, ""string"" might not be the right word; it sounds like the human players were basically routed. ""Over all games played, DeepStack won 492 mbb/g,"" the DeepStack paper reads. ""This is over 4 standard deviations away from zero, and so highly significant. Note that professional poker players consider 50 mbb/g a sizable margin."" It's also important to remember that these are games of no-limit, hold'em, which are significantly more complex than limit hold'em. Remember: in the limited format, bets and raises are capped at whatever the big blind is. No-limit hold'em, rather, lets players bet as much or as little as they want as long as it's over the minimum raise -- this is probably the format you're more familiar with if you enjoy watching people go all-in. In fact, it's safe to say the difference in the level of computational complexity between versions of the game is pretty staggering. After all, those looser rules allow for a higher degree of flexibility, to say nothing of sheer gamesmanship. An algorithm would have to factor in chip counts, the significance of these unlimited bets, how hands played in the past affect current strategy and more. That same team from the University of Alberta claimed to have solved limit hold'em entirely two years ago -- a testament to its relative simplicity -- and AI researcher Noam Brown said last March there's ""no chance"" no-limit hold'em will be solved in our lifetime. That doesn't mean Brown isn't going to try. The DeepStack paper was published just days before a team from Carnegie Mellon University is due to pit its own poker-playing AI against a handful of pro no-limit hold'em players in a Pittsburgh casino. (Whether the timing of the DeepStack announcement is a coincidence or a deviously brilliant bit of cutthroat academia is up to you.) This new AI -- Libratus -- was developed nearly from scratch by Ph.D. candidate Brown and CMU computer science professor Tuomas Sandholm, and will spend the next 20 days playing 120,000 hands against a quartet of competitors. While some poker critics gave the DeepStack announcement some flak because there didn't appear to be any top-tier players in the mix, Libratus is facing off against some well-known players. Of the four, California's Jason Les appears to be the most notable: he's ranked 198th on the Global Poker Index and has cleared $1 million in winnings. A string of decisive victories against these players could legitimize AI superiority over humans in yet another widely played game. The AI of the future won't just be after our pride as players -- they could easily come for our wallets, too.",ai
Roberto Baldwin,The biggest feature in self-driving cars will be entertainment.,2017-01-10T15:17:00-05:00,AI 'friends' will help you pass the time on autonomous drives,"Even more so than last year, CES 2017 was the unofficial auto show for the tech world. Automakers filled the North Hall and the Gold Lot of the Las Vegas Convention Center with self-driving prototypes and concept cars. But instead of talking about the power of Lidar or number-crunching processors, many started focusing on what the hell their passengers will do once they take their hands off the wheel. When autonomous cars hit the market, manually driven ones won't suddenly disappear. It'll be decades before self-driving vehicles take over the roads completely. That means the horrible traffic you're already stuck in might get a little better, but not by much. So instead of filling those moments by clutching the steering wheel and wishing death upon other drivers, you'll have a bunch of free time, and that's an opportunity for automakers to grab your eyes and ears. The last thing automakers want is for bored drivers to default to their current time killer: their phone. The problem for the companies is that if you get your entertainment from the computer in your pocket, it really doesn't matter which car you own. They're all going to get you to your destination without your input. So they've concocted a novel idea: the AI friend. Along with the deep learning that's keeping cars from shooting off the road and into ditches, automakers are also building you a friend that knows about your wants and needs. Plus, in addition to knowing your schedule and where you like to eat, these robots will know all about your feels. Both Toyota and Honda talked about their in-car AI systems detecting a driver's emotions and reacting either with music or restaurant recommendations. It's a future where you're being coddled by a car, and actually, that seems fine to me. Who wouldn't want a car that recognizes when you're feeling down, blasts Duran Duran and takes you to the best taco place in town? But those AI friends, like autonomous driving, are still a ways off. In the meantime, automakers are adding Alexa or (to a lesser extent) Cortana to their vehicles. Both of those platforms are setting the groundwork for a future in which you're completely comfortable telling your car almost anything and that data being used to offer up personalized suggestions. Many of the automakers also showed interiors with giant screens. To make sure the FF 91 never stops entertaining passengers, Faraday crammed a modem for every carrier into the car for high-speed broadband (and probably a high-priced phone bill). But while you're leaning back and watching The Princess Bride for the 27th time, you don't want to fiddle with interfaces and keyboards to take care of your business; you want a helper that's always listening and eager to please. Yes, CES had impressive autonomous vehicles that focused solely on the technology of keeping cars on the road. The NVIDIA/Audi system was impressive. As was Delphi's latest self-driving car. But automakers have realized that if all the cars are basically doing the exact same thing regardless of what's making the wheels turn, they need to find another way to lure in new buyers. Right now, that means building a ""friend"" to woo potential customers. We should prepare ourselves for a new BFF that knows your favorite song and how many times a week you eat Taco Bell. So just lean back and relax: Your corporate-built AI friend has everything you need.",ai
Roberto Baldwin,,2017-01-09T14:13:00-05:00,Audi and NVIDIA give an AI a crash course in driving,"Many of the self-driving demonstrations at CES involved systems required months or even years of training. NVIDIA and Audi decided to see what they could do in four days. The automaker and chip company gave the AI installed on an Audi Q7 images of what it should perceive as a road including, white lines, orange cones, rows of rocks and a dirt road and that's it. It didn't program a path or even add any additional sensors beyond the single forward-facing camera. While the results were impressive, it's important to point out that this is only a very small part of an autonomous driving system. But it does show how powerful AIs have become and how quickly they can make sense of the real world. It's also helpful to know that if your path to work is under construction and lines have been redrawn, cars will be still be able to determine where they need to go. While it's important to have highly detailed maps for path planning, this research is important when those navigation tools haven't had a chance to take note of a roadway change.",ai
Jon Fingas,Just don't assume you'll see it on a Nokia-branded phone.,2017-01-09T10:38:00-05:00,Nokia appears to be working on its own AI assistant,"It seems that just about everyone wants to get into the AI assistant game. Nokia (the networking giant, not HMD Global's brand) has applied for a trademark on ""Viki,"" a chat- and voice-based helper for smartphones and the web. Details are scarce -- this is a trademark, not a patent -- but there's little doubt as to what it's for. The question is, what will Nokia do with it? Not surprisingly, the company isn't revealing much. ""Nokia registers trademarks from time to time,"" a spokesperson tells us, ""but we don't comment on how, whether or when they may be used for Nokia products or services."" And it's important to remember that companies sometimes register trademarks as safeguards. They may not intend to make a product, but they don't want someone else taking their naming scheme. You definitely can't assume that an assistant will show up in Nokia-branded smartphones. HMD Global may have the Nokia name under its belt, but that doesn't mean that it's working in concert with the original Finnish company. If Viki ever reaches the public, it could just as easily be shopped around to any smartphone maker or internet service that wants an AI solution.",ai
David Lumb,A startup built a system that culls callers' information from databases and public social media profiles to better match them with an associate.,2017-01-09T10:19:00-05:00,AI might handpick your customer service rep,"There are certainly ways to use tech to augment customer service, like Twitter's auto-replies for public-facing business accounts. But if you've called a large company's helpline and gotten a representative that was atypically, unusually helpful, latch on to that uncertainty: Your hotline helper might have been hand-picked for you by an AI system. The startup Afiniti International Holdings has installed just such a setup in over 150 call centers to better match callers with associates who have successfully helped similar folks. To build a profile of the caller, Afiniti's tech pulls up their purchase and contact history and business/credit profile. Since this is 2017, it also automatically crawls the internet to find their public Facebook, Twitter and LinkedIn pages. Finally, it fills out the profile by examining census archives of the caller's area. If the associate on the other end of the phone is in sales, they'll be matched with callers similar to those they've more successfully sold to in the past. The associates can't see callers' personal data, Afiniti maintains, and they don't know why they're matched to whom: it's all done in the background by the company's AI system. But simply having scores and metrics invisible to callers is worrying some privacy advocates. ""There's a process of discrimination going on,"" University of Pennsylvania professor Joseph Turow, who studies digital marketing, told The Wall Street Journal. ""Companies are bringing data together that we have no knowledge about, and it may discriminate against in a prejudicial sense or a positive sense, depending on who we are."" Afiniti's careful to note where it claims to pull its data from, according to The Wall Street Journal : From up to 100 databases that are legitimately available for purchase, like credit firm Experian and data clearinghouse Acxiom Corp, and only social media data from callers' profiles that had been made public. But if you're worried about making a simple customer service call and getting slotted a salesperson expressly skilled at upselling people like you, it might be too late: Your data's already out there.",ai
Jon Fingas,You won't always have to speak to Android's AI helper to get answers.,2017-01-07T23:51:00-05:00,Google Assistant hints at support for typing questions,"Google Assistant is clever -- just ask Pixel or Home owners. Unless you're using Allo , though, you have little choice but to ask the AI questions through voice commands. Google might give you more ways to interact in the near future, however. An exploration of the Android search app's beta code has uncovered hints (namely, a keyboard icon and a text box) that you'll soon have the option of typing your Assistant searches. This is important if you'd rather not reveal your queries to everyone within earshot, but it should also be key to integrating chat bots. It might be easier to start a search, too. There are references in the beta to ""search gestures"" that suggest you won't always have to tap the search bar to start asking. Instead, you'd swipe down from the home screen. That could be particularly important for very large phones and tablets, where it can be a pain to reach across the display. Don't count on the relevant upgrades showing up all that quickly. Unused code frequently pops up in Google apps , and it can take months or more for those features to be ready for prime time if they aren't canned outright. Both additions are very logical, though, so it's doubtful that Google will keep you waiting for too long.",ai
Christopher Trout,,2017-01-06T17:00:00-05:00,"Sony's Kaz Hirai: 4K and HDR are here, robots are coming","By all accounts, Sony played it safe at CES this year. Outside of an OLED TV that projects sound from its screen, the company was light on game-changing product announcements.

Last July, Hirai announced that Sony was reinvesting in AI in a big way for the first time since cutting funding in 2006. He says its ambitions go far beyond a refreshed Aibo, but not to rule out the possibility of robopup resurrection.

Jamie Rigg,The AI-powered app will ask users about their symptoms and suggest next steps.,2017-01-05T09:15:00-05:00,UK health service to trial chatbot that gives medical advice,"The UK's National Health Service (NHS) is to begin trialing a chatbot app for dispensing medical advice, with the aim of reducing the burden on its 111 non-emergency helpline. The 111 service went live in 2013, and serves as the first port of call for urgent advice in cases where it's likely overkill to scream for an ambulance right away -- if you've misread a prescription and taken more pills than you should've, for example. The AI-powered app could become another alternative, questioning users about their medical matter and symptoms before suggesting the best course of action. The NHS is developing the app with Babylon Health , one of the new breed of paid, doctor on-demand services. It's actually being adapted from Babylon's existing mobile app, which features a chatbot-like symptom questionnaire users interact with before being connected with a general practitioner (GP) via video call. The app isn't being designed to replace the 111 helpline -- call handlers have the added abilities of booking out-of-hours doctor appointments and dispatching ambulances -- but to dispense advice all the same. The six-month trial will begin at the end of January and will initially be open to over a million people in the North London area. Whether it becomes a nationwide service will depend on engagement figures, user experience and its impact on GP and hospital accident and emergency visits, the NHS told the Financial Times. Trusting a chatbot with your wellbeing may seem like a scary prospect, not the mention questions around liability. But Babylon claims that its ""AI technology can process billions of symptom combinations much faster and more accurately than the human brain."" Also, the fact is most 111 workers aren't medical professionals, and simply take callers through a pathway of questioning that ends in semi-scripted advice. And just because 111 lets you speak to a talk to an actual human doesn't necessarily make it more reliable. As The Telegraph notes , the 111 service has drawn serious criticism for letting calls go unanswered, failing to identify serious conditions, offering inappropriate advice and contributing to an increase in accident and emergency admissions.",ai
Devindra Hardawar,You'll either love or hate the Co-Pilot.,2017-01-04T22:41:00-05:00,NVIDIA built an AI backseat driver for its new AI car platform,"NVIDIA hasn't been shy about promoting its automative breakthroughs over the years, but now it's actually beginning to seem real. At the company's CES keynote, NVIDIA CEO Jen-Hsun Huang revealed an AI car platform that will feature an ""AI co-pilot"" to assist you while driving. It could, for example, map your face to detect your mood, or see where your head is pointed to alert you if you're distracted. And, like every good backseat driver, it's not afraid to comment on your driving. NVIDIA Co-pilot has a pleasant, if somewhat stiff, voice, based on the demos we saw. But even if it's trying to be gentle, it's hard not to get a HAL 9000 vibe from its warnings. In fact, Huang mentioned it can even read your lips in noisy environments -- and we all know how well that worked out 2001. Seriously, though, Co-pilot seems like it could be a useful addition to plenty of cars. It could make driving a lot safer until autonomous cars are readily available (and legal).",ai

Jamie Rigg,Kolibree's Ara uses deep learning to analyze your brushing habits.,2017-01-03T14:22:00-05:00,Even smart toothbrushes have AI now,"Before the likes of Oral-B started selling Bluetooth-enabled, app-connected toothbrushes, there was Kolibree. The startup developed one of the first smart toothbrushes that incentivized regular brushing and documented oral hygiene habits. We caught the first Kolibree brush at CES several years ago ahead of its successful Kickstarter campaign , and this year the company is back at the tech show with a new model: the Ara. So, what's the latest innovation in smart toothbrushes? AI, of course. ""Patented deep learning algorithms are embedded directly inside the toothbrush on a low-power processor,"" Kolibree's press release reads. One of the benefits of this new chip is that you don't need the companion app open on your mobile for brushing data to be recorded. The device can store all the info from its bevy of motion sensors in offline mode, syncing up with the app next time you load it. The primary reason for the AI component, though, is so the brush can analyze your behavior and provide more-personalized feedback regarding your poor hygiene -- either at a glance within the app or via a weekly email report. Health care is one of the most promising avenues for AI, where complex data-crunching can potentially improve our understanding and treatment of diseases. But do we need to cram Jarvis into an electric toothbrush? One ""leading health insurer"" in Italy thinks it's more than a buzzword, at least, having committed to offering the Ara to its clients. Kolibree also plans to start a study this spring in Europe and the US to clinically validate the value of AI in improving oral health. If you're less cynical than us, the Ara is now available to pre-order from Kolibree for $79 until the end of February, at which point the introductory price will jump to $129.",ai
Roberto Baldwin,"A tour of the automaker’s future, and sometimes weird, innovations.",2017-01-02T15:30:00-05:00,Inside Mercedes' Silicon Valley research center,"A metal typewriter sits on a pedestal churning out the next sentence of a collaborative story. For every line I typed onto paper, the AI computer controlling the hunk of metal replies with what it thinks would be a good follow-up. The goal of the experiment is to see what happens when you feed an artificial intelligence only fairy tales. It's the kind of seemingly idiosyncratic thing you'd expect from IBM, Google or Apple. But I actually found it inside Mercedes-Benz's R&D North American headquarters in Silicon Valley. try{document.getElementById(""aol-cms-player-1"").style.display=""none"";}catch(e){} The German automaker is trying to see what happens when you let a computer learn how to write, space and spell on its own. The experiment could help researchers build an artificial brain for a car that could independently deduce and react to what's happening on the road. It might seem like these things are unrelated, but a typewriter cranking out sentences and a car automatically braking to miss an object in the road are both using the learn-and-react system of AI to get a job done. All that deep learning is one building blocks of autonomous systems. Another important aspect of self-driving cars is that the computers needed to keep them on the road not only have to learn and react but actually see what's going on. Most automakers use Lidar to scan the surrounding world with lasers to create a vast pixel map. The amount of data created by all those pinpoints is staggering. Mercedes thinks it's solved the problem of trying to crunch all that information by joining blocks of pixels to create single objects. So instead of an automobile trying to decipher 500,000 pixels, the car has to figure out the location of only 1,000 object-specific rectangles called ""Stixels."" Each Stixel can be a person, car or object and is assigned a color based on how close it is to the vehicle. Experiments like this are part of the company's new CASE (Connected, Autonomous Driving, Shared usage and Electric drive) strategy. Mercedes wants to build its own future instead of teaming up with a tech company. When you're beholden to another entity, you're stuck with whatever it decides to add to its platform. So Mercedes has its Silicon Valley facility working hard on a variety of initiatives. During a recent tour of the R&D headquarters, I saw the shiniest result of those initiatives and latest CASE project, the EQ concept vehicle it unveiled at the Paris Auto show. The electric car has autonomous features, replaced the dash with a giant display and shed all of its mirrors in favor of tiny cameras. While the vehicle looks like it's a prop from a reboot of Tron , it's actually the launching pad of the EQ line of vehicles and home-energy storage. Sadly, the concept vehicle on display will never appear in showrooms. Instead, it's a marketing tool for the launch of the EQ brand of vehicles and mobility initiatives that will start appearing in three years. It's a new category within Mercedes similar to Smart, its small-car subsidiary. But while the new business venture is a ways off, the automaker is already adding connected features to its current and upcoming lineup of Mercedes-Benz vehicles. It has an iOS and Apple Watch companion app for locking the doors. In the next year, it'll add Google Home support. Drivers will be able to interact with thesearch giant's Home assistant with the sound of their voice while driving. The integration will also learn a person's habits and will offer to turn on or off devices based on the car's location via AI. Don't worry if you're already part of the Alexa or HomeKit ecosystem — both of those platforms are being investigated. But it's not just the cars Mercedes sells to individuals that are being upgraded. The automaker is working on speeding up deliveries from services like UPS, FedEX and DHL. In a garage a few miles from the main building, a team of researchers is building a carpetlike covering for the shelves and floor of a delivery van that can weigh a package no matter where it is. I was initially unsure why the weight of each box was important. That was until they explained that the system can pinpoint the location of any item in the truck based on its mass and can have nearby LEDs light up when the driver needs to find said package. According to Mercedes, tests of the system with local delivery drivers have increased efficiency 35 percent. The drivers no longer have to hunt for a box that slid around the back of the truck during a sharp turn; the system just knows where everything is. It's research like this that could help the automaker maintain the pace needed to compete in the increasingly accelerating automotive tech landscape. It's a legacy brand that's seen cars changing quicker in the past few years than in the previous 90. It's done a good job keeping up, but pressure from Tesla, Google and established automakers means Mercedes has to be more nimble and think outside horsepower and tires. Even if it means experiments with mechanical typewriters and fairy tales.",ai
Steve Dent,"Using gold nanoparticles and AI, a device correctly diagnosed 86 percent of patients.",2016-12-29T07:01:00-05:00,Simple breath test can detect cancer and 16 other diseases,"Ancient Greek physicians figured that our breath was a strong health indicator , but researchers from the Israel Institute of Technology have proven just how true that is. They developed a device that uses nanoparticles to identify 17 different diseases, including lung cancer and Parkinson's disease, from just a single breath. While the machine isn't accurate enough yet for real-life clinical diagnoses, it shows high promise as a quick, non-invasive test that could catch diseases in their early stages The team tested breath samples from more than 1,400 patients and identified 13 chemicals found in eight types of cancers, Crohn's disease, Parkinson's disease, pulmonary hypertension and other diseases. Each of those volatile organic compounds is present in varying amounts, forming a distinctive ""fingerprint"" for each ailment. ""These odor signatures are what enables us to identify the diseases using the technology that we developed,"" says research lead Prof. Hossam Haick. To pick up the presence and ratio of the chemicals, the team built an ""artificially intelligent nanoarray"" called the Na-Nose. It uses specific sensors, like one made from gold nanoparticles and another that uses a network of carbon nanotubes , to sense the different compounds. The data is then analyzed by an artificial intelligence system, which takes into account age, gender and other factors, picking out the right affliction 86 percent of the time. That's not enough accuracy for clinical diagnosis, but it could eventually be used as a routine test to catch diseases in their early phases when they're much more treatable. ""For example, in the case of lung cancer we can increase the survival rate from 10 to 70 percent by early diagnosis,"" Haick said in a video (above). It could even be used to identify people who aren't sick yet, but have a higher risk than others for certain conditions. Moreover, Haick adds, ""it is available without the need for invasive and unpleasant procedures, it's not dangerous, and you can sample it again and again if necessary.""",ai
Timothy J. Seppala,Ultrasonic microphones can detect aberrations in mechanical sounds and alert the operator before a problem happens.,2016-12-27T22:37:00-05:00,Deep learning could predict car trouble before you notice it,"Trying to replicate the sounds your car is making to the mechanic you're talking to is equal parts frustrating and embarrassing. But neural networks could put your best ""worn out wheel bearing"" impression into retirement. Israeli company 3DSignals uses deep learning to keep track of sounds, listening for deviations from the norm in musical and mechanical acoustics. According to an interview with IEEE Spectrum , the company is in talks with ""leading European automakers"" to put its ultrasonic microphones in their cars. But rather than consumer vehicles, the focus seems to be on applications for autonomous taxis. The idea is that before a problem happens, the operator will know as soon as there's an aberration in the car's normal operating sounds. ""When trained, the 3DSignals deep learning algorithms are able to identify [and] predict specific problems in advance with 98 percent accuracy,"" IEEE Spectrum reports. The tech is already in place in industrial applications , but 3DSignals' clients have to do some of the heavy lifting in terms of training the detection algorithms. People are still manually labeling specific sound signatures that indicate problems, so it might be a bit before we see widespread adoption of the system. Given BMW's eye toward the future and Volkswagen's aim to launch self-driving taxis , those might be where it'll show up first.",ai
Jon Fingas,We've come a long way from the S Voice days.,2016-12-27T13:34:00-05:00,Samsung's Galaxy S8 reportedly uses AI across all its apps,"Samsung has been eager to drum up attention for the Galaxy S8's AI assistant , but just how is it going to work, exactly? We still don't have the clearest picture, but some details might be coming to light. A SamMobile source claims that the Viv-based , voice-guided helper (reportedly named Bixby) will have a presence in all the of the phone's included Samsung-made apps. You could use it in the Gallery app to show you photos of the beach, for example. This isn't a radical development when both Google Photos and iOS 10 can accomplish similar feats, but remember that Bixby is likely replacing S Voice, Samsung's aging in-house software -- the point is to offer software smart enough that you don't need to turn to another assistant. The Korean tech giant had already hinted that you won't need to dive into specific apps to perform many tasks, and that it'll offer support for third-party apps. Again, these aren't new to Bixby, but they represent a big leap over what S Voice can do. As SamMobile suggests, the big question is how Google will react to this new AI. After all, Google is making a big push for Assistant. What happens when its largest Android hardware partner builds technology that effectively replaces its pride and joy? The two companies are on friendlier terms than they were a couple of years ago , but something tells us that Google won't be all that enthusiastic.",ai
Mat Smith,Bandai Namco is investing in an AI startup whose board-game algorithms have defeated several professional human players.,2016-12-27T10:02:00-05:00,'Dark Souls' publisher bets on AI for smarter game foes,"Bandai Namco, the games company behind Tekken , Dark Souls and a whole bunch of Dragonball games , has invested in an artificial intelligence startup. The team at Heroz have an algorithm for shogi (Japanese chess) that's bested several professional human players in public matches. Bandai Namco is hoping to tap into that know-how to improve its non-playing character behavior in future titles, although expect to see it in much simpler games long before that eventual Dark Souls successor. Heroz has dabbled with games outside the likes of chess and backgammon. Earlier in 2016, it worked with the Pokemon Company to make Pokemon Co-master , a figurine-battling board game for smartphones that ( according to Nikkei ) didn't do so well. The startup is hoping that Bandai Namco's expertise will help ensure a hit. Heroz' expertise in traditional (and cutesy-character based) games could ensure it's well-placed to develop for Sony's incoming Project Field product.

Jon Fingas,It's proof the company is willing to open up in the name of science.,2016-12-26T15:28:00-05:00,Apple publishes its first AI research paper,"When Apple said it would publish its artificial intelligence research , it raised at least a couple of big questions. When would we see the first paper? And would the public data be important, or would the company keep potential trade secrets close to the vest? At last, we have answers. Apple researchers have published their first AI paper, and the findings could clearly be useful for computer vision technology. The paper tackles the problem of teaching AI to recognize objects using simulated images, which are easier to use than photos (since you don't need a human to tag items) but poor for adapting to real-world situations. The trick, Apple says, is to use the increasingly popular technique of pitting neural networks against each other : one network trains itself to improve the realism of simulated images (in this case, using photo examples) until they're good enough to fool a rival ""discriminator"" network. Ideally, this pre-training would save massive amounts of time and account for hard-to-predict situations that don't always turn up in photos. This doesn't mean that Apple is suddenly an open book. It could take years before it's clear how transparent Apple has become with its scientific findings. However, this is a big step -- if also a necessary one. AI is an increasingly competitive field, and Apple's past reluctance to contribute to scientific knowledge may have scared away potential hires who wanted their discoveries recognized. If papers like these become relatively commonplace, Apple might have an easier time attracting the talent it needs for self-driving car platforms , Siri and other AI-based projects.",ai
Mona Lalwani,"Our board games, our phones, our living rooms, our cars and even our doctor’s offices.",2016-12-25T17:30:00-05:00,AI was everywhere in 2016,"At the Four Seasons hotel in South Korea, AlphaGO stunned grandmaster Lee Sodol at the complex and highly intuitive game of Go. Google's artificially intelligent system defeated the 18-time world champion in a string of games earlier this year. Backed by the company's superior machine-learning techniques, AlphaGo had processed thousands and thousands of Go moves from previous human-to-human games to develop its own ability to think strategically. The AlphaGo games, watched by millions of viewers on YouTube, revealed the ever-increasing power and progress of AI. This contest between man and machine was not the first of its kind. But this time it was more than just a computer beating a human at a game. AlphaGo not only conquered the complexities of the game but seemed to surpass the intelligence of the grandmaster across the board game. The unpredictable moves that shocked Sodol (and the world) revealed AlphaGo's ability to think and respond creatively. It is the kind of intelligence that has long been an asset for Hollywood's all-powerful versions of AI, but one that had been unattainable for computers in reality. That victory marked a shift in the trajectory of AI this year. The technology that has long been aimed at replicating human intelligence now seems to be paying attention to human patterns and behaviors. Recent advances in deep learning have enabled that kind of insight, but it's not limited to beating humans at games. In 2016, AI broke out of the confines of research labs to transform the way we live, communicate and even conserve the planet. Chatbots popped up in group texts. Personal assistants invaded our homes. Cognitive systems are detecting cancer. Bots are writing movie scripts. And car makers are gearing up to unleash a bevy of autonomous vehicles onto public roads. For a few years now, a cohort of mobile assistants like Siri, Cortana and the new Google Assistant has been getting people in the habit of talking to their devices so they can spend less time swiping screens. But now, these personal assistants are swiftly moving past the basics of reminders and internet searches. They are invading our homes as efficient helpers. One of the highlights in the talking-devices category this year was Google Home. The voice-activated speaker, designed for personal spaces, joined the ranks of Amazon Echo. These at-home digital helpers carry the same promise of efficiency as their smartphone counterparts, but they seem to have a different agenda. They are efficient assistants that not only want to understand human needs, but predict them to create an environment of reliance and reciprocity. That kind of environment, depicted in movies like Her and Iron Man , is essential to the next stage of human-machine interaction where assistants can turn off the lights in a room for you and also, one day, tell you when you're out of diapers for your child. Mark Zuckerberg's Jarvis , a Morgan Freeman-voiced AI helper he recently built for his own house, is a glimpse into the kind of personalized AI that will coexist in the connected homes of the future. The ability to comprehend humans is integral to AI in all its forms, present and future. With the recent boost in speech-recognition and natural-language-processing techniques, machines are getting closer to understanding humans than ever before. With companies like Tesla , GM, BMW , Fiat Chrysler all rolling out autonomous vehicles, the ability to communicate with these moving machines will play a pivotal role in making the experience stress-free. Smart cars promise to bring down the frequency and casualties of road accidents. They are also expected to boost mobility for the elderly and people with disabilities. This summer, that promise came under scrutiny for a fatal Tesla crash. But a couple of months later, when a Missouri-based lawyer suffered a pulmonary embolism while driving on the freeway, the autopilot in his Tesla Model X reportedly drove him to the hospital and saved his life. Just as the narrative started to shift back to the benefits of self-driving cars, Uber launched its semiautonomous fleet of Volvos in Pittsburgh. The ride-sharing company also rolled out its autonomous car service in San Francisco this month, but city officials swiftly cracked down on the company because it did not have the state permits required to operate the cars. This week, Uber pulled back from the city and is now looking to redeploy the vehicles in Arizona. Uber's antics aside, the enthusiasm around self-driving vehicles has been palpable. Whether we see AI increasing mobility for people who need the autonomous services the most is still a thing of the future. But the one area where AI is already pitching in is medicine. With troves of raw medical data being gathered through computers and personal devices across the world, doctors are increasingly turning to algorithms and cognitive computing systems for help. While access to the data is transforming the way doctors diagnose diseases, the sheer volume of data has made it virtually impossible for doctors to process the information for a timely diagnosis. It's also increasingly hard for a doctor to match the information intake of a computer brain like IBM's Watson that has the ability to absorb every medical journal that has ever been written. In addition to already deploying Watson in major hospitals, IBM recently partnered with more than a dozen cancer institutes to train its cognitive system. The exposure will enable Watson to find personalized treatments for patients who have already tried existing treatments with no success. The diagnostic potential of AI also extended to the field of ophthalmology. According to a study, Google's deep learning algorithm was able to detect diabetic retinopathy through photographs. The most common method for determining signs of diabetic eye disease, which reportedly affects about 415 million people across the world, is to have a doctor examine the images of the back of the eye for lesions. But a recent experiment revealed that Google's algorithm was able to recognize the lesions as accurately as the doctors. While the company points out that a lot more work needs to be done in this area, the initial results reveal that AI assistance could speed up a doctor's diagnoses drastically. This year, AI also pitched in to save the planet. From water conservation in California to saving tuna in Palau, AI was deployed in environmental efforts across the world. OmniEarth, an environmental-analytics organization, used Watson to map and classify irrigated and nonirrigated areas through satellite images to improve water conservation in California. IBM's AI was able to process the images 40 times faster than humans who were tasked with the job. The Nature Conservancy , a global nonprofit, also turned to machine learning as it ramped up efforts in the Pacific region of Palau to monitor fishing activities. The organization already equipped a fleet of ships with cameras and GPS devices to hold fisheries accountable for their catch. But last month, it launched a competition to find an algorithm that can speed up the process of identifying sharks, tuna or turtles that might be brought on board the ships. The presence of AI was felt and needed in both personal spaces and far-off reaches of the Earth. But it was not entirely unexpected. The preoccupation to make computers think like humans has been evident for decades and 2016 was as much a culmination of those efforts as an indication of things to come. Despite the constant debate around the dangers of AI, with every new development machines become more capable of human thought. And the concept of intelligence is no longer limited to personal assistance or medical-speak. For a technology that's built on human culture, it's bound to tackle avenues of creativity. Benjamin , a self-improving neural network, wrote its own short sci-fi movie in June. The AI, which is good at text recognition, was fed human screenplays so it could learn to write a script. The film, titled Sunspring , turned out to be an incoherent mess, but it reportedly picked up on the repetitions and patterns of human writing. The scriptwriting AI might not be ready for the film circuit, but it seemed to follow in the footsteps of AlphaGo whose stunning victory in Korea already revealed AI's capacity for creative intelligence.

Jon Fingas,The Facebook exec's creation illustrates the promises and piftalls of virtual assistants.,2016-12-19T15:23:00-05:00,Mark Zuckerberg explains how he wrote his home AI,"Ever since Mark Zuckerberg revealed his intention to create his own AI helper , some questions have loomed large: just how would he go about it? And can one man write an effective artificial intelligence when it frequently requires whole teams? At last, the Facebook CEO has provided some answers. The Zuckerberg has written a lengthy piece explaining not only how he created the Jarvis AI that's running his home, but the inherent challenges in making an assistant that works the way you'd expect. Some parts of the process were easier than expected. He created a Facebook Messenger chat bot to start with instead of writing a dedicated app (an always-listening voice app came later), and took advantage of Facebook's facial recognition for his door-facing cameras. He even managed to get the AI to thrive on relatively ""open-ended"" requests where it learns what works. Zuck can tell Jarvis whether or not songs are ""light,"" for example, and teach it to play mood-appropriate music without having to request specific tracks. At the same time, Zuckerberg ran into numerous headaches. Despite loads of smart household equipment (such as Crestron home automation, Sonos audio and a Nest Cam ), the executive found himself reverse-engineering code and even jury-rigging appliances to get things online. He also discovered that context is a problem: if you ask to turn on the air conditioning in ""my office,"" does the AI know whose office it is? Voice recognition systems are very geared toward structured commands, Zuckerberg says, and aren't very good at understanding conversational speech. Jarvis is one of Zuckerberg's yearly personal challenges, and isn't likely to see extensive work after this. However, the tech mogul isn't dropping everything after this. He wants to write an Android app (the listening client is iOS-only), string more listening stations around his home and connect more appliances. He'd also like to give the AI more independence: he wants it to learn skills on its own, and would like to make his technology available if he can abstract it. The software is currently built around the Zuckerberg's specific needs, so he can't just release it as-is. Whatever happens, don't be surprised if the effort behind Jarvis influences Facebook's larger AI strategy.",ai

Mat Smith,Gatebox AI is no Amazon Echo rival.,2016-12-16T13:36:00-05:00,This virtual assistant looks like an anime girl trapped in a coffee pot,"Gatebox AI is an unusual virtual assistant that involves a projected CGI character kind-of trapped in a jar -- with voice controls! The sales pitch is that this virtual assistant will give the sensation of living with a fictional character, or according to how creator Vinclu Inc. words it, ""your heroes"". Which is fine, if your hero is a non-spectacular CGI anime character with blue hair and excessively submissive temperament. Behind the virtual idol/slave gloss, Gatebox AI's assistant functions approach a bare-bones Amazon Echo. According to the preorder site, Gatebox's debut character Hikari has the ""ultimate healing voice"" (uh huh) and the J-Pop AI will adjust to your daily rhythms, welcoming you home or sensing when you get up. According to the demo video, the CGI ""dimension traveller"" will be able to switch on your lights and other home appliances based on your movement or orders. The device includes infrared tech, meaning it should be able to talk to not-so-smart home appliances that aren't WiFi-connected. (Of course, there's WiFi and Bluetooth connectivity for anything smart you do own.) The character is made up of a two-dimensional rear projected image, and you'll be able to play other videos if you hook-up a PC to its HDMI port. When it comes to interacting with users, the Gatebox has a camera and other (unspecified) sensors to detect movement and even the owner's face. Unlike the Echo (or even Siri), you'll have to physically press the mic button on the Gatebox to talk to your rear-projected idol; the device won't just pick up your oral commands. The company admits there's only limited conversation interactions anyhow, although there's a text message-based Chatbot for Hikari if you're also not much of a talker. You'll be able to text the her, even though she isn't real. She'll get lonely if you come home late, apparently, but again, she is not real. There's a limited run of 300 Gearboxes, on preorder til mid January 2017, with delivery currently penned for December 2017. You'll have to really like the idea of a tiny trapped anime character of your own: preorders cost 298,000 yen -- which is roughly $2500. Hit up the creepy source links for more details.

It's testing an M suggestions feature that has the artificial intelligence offer actions depending on the circumstances in your chat. Some will be familiar: if a friend asks where you are, it'll give you a Google Hangouts-style opportunity to share your location. Others are more creative, such as suggesting stickers in response to common phrases like ""thanks."" Only a handful of people in the US will see the suggestions right now, and it's not certain how quickly it will expand. Messenger team lead David Marcus is optimistic, however. He tells BuzzFeed News that M suggestions may well accelerate the deployment of Facebook's AI by making it available to a much wider audience than the M assistant you see in testing right now. It won't be as deep as a direct interaction with M, but it would certainly be more accessible -- important when Google is ramping up its own AI chat helpers.",ai
Tom Regan,"Finally, a customer service agent that won’t put you on hold.",2016-12-14T12:30:00-05:00,Microsoft will give Skype chatbots a voice next year,"Not content with just stuffing Cortana into your home appliances , Microsoft now wants you to have real conversations with needy Skype bots. In a bid to make those awkward chatbot encounters feel more natural, next year will see the company granting third parties access to its Skype calling API. With this, Microsoft partners like StubHub and Expedia will be able to give their bots a voice, offering users an alternative to text chat. Aside from being more engaging conversationalists, these talking bots will also be able to use video, audio and GIFs in Skype chat windows. While Microsoft's push to make scripted interactions less painful is certainly admirable, and makes sense given the trend towards more natural voice controls , these Skype chatbots will have something to prove. In an age where all we want is to achieve our daily tasks as quickly as possible, the last thing we want to do is actually talk to anyone -- and for many, that still includes relatively helpful robots.",ai
Steve Dent,Add Cortana to emails and it'll find the best time for everyone to meet.,2016-12-14T10:44:00-05:00,Microsoft's Cortana bot can schedule meetings on your behalf,"Microsoft is trying to turn Cortana into the digital assistant of your dreams with a new AI bot called Calendar.help. The beta service requires an invitation , but once signed up, you link it to your Outlook, Google or Office 365 calendar apps. Then, when it's time to schedule a meeting, send an email to attendees and Cc: Cortana. The message can include natural language like ""sometime next week"" or ""make this a Skype meeting."" From there, it'll look at your calendar and contact other attendees by itself to find the best time for everyone. Cortana keeps things moving along by following up if recipients don't reply within 48 hours until it finally fixes a date. It then creates an event in your calendar and sends a clickable invitation to all parties, signing off with ""Warmly yours, Cortana"" and a fancy signature, denoting itself as ""Scheduling Assistant to [your name here]."" If this works as well as it sounds, it could be the useful (and ego-stroking) helper bot that busy folks without the cash to pay a human assistant have been waiting for. ""All interactions are natural and conversational -- as if a real-life assistant was coordinating the meeting,"" Microsoft says. It adds that it's powered by both machine and human intelligence, meaning that Microsoft employees might intervene when the machine can't handle the job alone. Microsoft launched the bot at its AI day in San Francisco, where it also revealed a Cortana-powered Harmon Kardon speaker to rival Amazon's Echo and Google Home. As mentioned, you'll need to join a waiting list to get Calendar.help, and Microsoft says it's favoring ""those who frequently schedule meetings with people outside their organization."" That means Office 365 business customers may get first dibs, but the program should roll out more widely in the days to come.",ai
Aaron Souppouris,A partnership with Harman Kardon could be the first of many Cortana speakers.,2016-12-14T05:50:00-05:00,Microsoft's Amazon Echo competitor will launch next year,"Microsoft is partnering with the ( soon-to-be Samsung-owned ) audio company Harman Kardon to launch a speaker with its Cortana personal assistant built in. Described as ""a voice-activated speaker,"" a short teaser video shows glimpses of a (rendered) cylindrical design not too dissimilar to Amazon's Echo. It also takes cues from Google Home, with a display atop fashioned after Cortana's familiar blue circle that shows when the assistant is thinking. Unfortunately, the teaser video is all we have to go on, and that only tells us the device is ""coming in 2017."" It seems a pretty safe bet that it won't be the only speaker with Cortana built in, though. Microsoft is making a big push into the ""internet of things"" with the Cortana Devices SDK , hoping to partner with many manufacturers to bring the assistant to various devices and appliances. In a blog post announcing the SDK , Microsoft describes Harman Kardon as ""one early device partner,"" noting that the speaker company will have ""more news to share next year about their plans."" Still, if you were holding out for a Microsoft version of the Echo or Home, this looks to be the closest you'll get to it for some time. We could still see a Surface- or Microsoft-branded speaker at some point, of course, but for now, Microsoft seems content to rely solely on partners to take on Amazon and Google.",ai

As part of a WinHEC presentation , the company's May Ji has revealed that Windows 10 Creator Update will bring Cortana to Windows 10 IoT Core devices with screens. Combined with longer-ranged voice detection (key to Microsoft's Home Hub plans ), you wouldn't have to be anywhere near a PC to use the digital helper -- you could ask your thermostat about the weather, or add an appointment to your calendar through your fridge. Those concepts aren't new , of course, but Cortana can sync with your phone and Windows PC on a level that isn't possible with most smart home devices. The Creators Update arrives in spring 2017, although you won't necessarily see Cortana-equipped appliances shipping at the same time. Hardware makers will still have to integrate the new Windows 10 release into their products, so it could take some months after that before you're upgrading your home. Even so, it could be a big deal when it arrives. Most smart home equipment doesn't have direct access to an advanced voice assistant -- this would make the technology virtually ubiquitous.",ai
Jon Fingas,AutoMod can clean up conversations without many of the usual hassles.,2016-12-12T13:00:00-05:00,Twitch uses machine learning to moderate your stream chats,"Sure, you can already take steps to keep your Twitch chat friendly, but it's a lot of work if you don't have a team of moderators. Do you really want to watch conversations like a hawk in case someone gets around your meticulously crafted filters? You might not have to after today. Twitch is introducing an AutoMod feature that uses a mix of machine learning and natural language processing to keep ""inappropriate content"" out of your stream chats. It not only screens for offensive language, but can spot attempts to dodge your filters through clever uses of characters and emoji. You can even set a general filtering level to determine just how profane you'd like chat to be. If a message does run afoul of your settings, AutoMod will hold it in a publishing queue for you or moderators. You can make exceptions, in other words, or allow messages that clearly should have gone through. The AutoMod app is available right now for English broadcasters, and as a beta in 12 other languages (including European languages, Japanese, Korean, Russian and Turkish).

Sean Buckley,,2017-04-06T15:00:00-04:00,Explore Japanese gaming culture in 360 degrees with MatPat,"Matthew Patrick is best known as the guy on YouTube who uses math, science and rabid curiosity to build intense, unexpected narratives from the stray plot threads of movies and video games. As the Game Theorists' MatPat , he asks if Mario is secretly a sociopath and questions if Sega's blue hedgehog really is the fastest mascot in gaming -- and then backs up his allegations by covertly teaching viewers about actual psychology and the speed of sound. Now he's expanding his passion for making entertainment educational with a travel show called The Global Gamer. Oh, and he's doing it in 360-degree virtual reality -- and you can watch the launch exclusively right here on Engadget. The Global Gamer is one part passion for travel and one part YouTube content deal. ""It was a converging of a lot of worlds,"" Patrick told Engadget. The idea for a gamer-orientated travel show had been germinating in his mind for a while. ""My wife and I were really passionate about traveling internationally and experiencing new cultures,"" he said. ""If we could translate those experiences through the lens of gaming and get other people -- younger, digital-first audiences -- excited about learning about different cultures through the lens of gaming, that was kind of our goal with this series."" When Google approached The Game Theorists about working on a show for its Daydream initiative, The Global Gamer seemed like the perfect fit. With Google's 8K Jump VR cameras , the program could do more than just show gamers other cultures around the world -- it could bring them along for the ride. Despite the backing of Google's Daydream team, 360-degree video is a relatively new idea , and Patrick is well aware of its growing pains. ""Honestly, this whole thing is a big experiment,"" he says. From his work on the 360 segments of GameLab -- his YouTube Red show -- Patrick knows that VR videos have significantly lower engagement than traditional 2D viewing experiences. The audience just isn't sure how to approach the content. ""They start to suffer from decision fatigue,"" he says, ""and their minds start to wander because they have to be an active participant in the 360 experience. ""It goes to that whole idea that they're deciding what they're looking at at any given point,"" he says, likening the production of 360 video to directing for the theatrical stage. The camera captures everything around the scene, not just its focal point. ""You can't necessarily control where the audience is looking at any given moment, but you always want to have a clear throughline of action or movement or sound to guide them."" The Global Gamer does this by deftly balancing the 360-VR experience with a more traditional viewing paradigm. Yes, this travel adventure is best when viewed through a phone or browser to explore the 360 environment, or, better still, in a VR headset like Daydream -- but if you pull the video up on a TV, you won't miss out on the core experience. If the subject of a scene walks out of view, something appropriate almost always fills the space, be it a bisected scene that matches the ongoing narration, a graphic that illustrates the point or just a pop-up window in the center of the screen showing viewers what they would be seeing if they had followed the subject out of frame. This makes the content work without the 360 trick, but it's still an experience tailor-made for immersive viewing. Patrick's journey between the shrines and cultural practices of old Japan and the arcades and fashion worlds of modern Japan is cut so the viewer almost feels like she's hanging out with a friend in a tour group. As the video walks through the busy marketplace of Senso-Ji temple, the viewer has the option to look away from Patrick's narration and explore the shops, admire the shrine architecture or watch the tourists gawk at the 360 camera driving the experience -- all while listening in on the conversation of her digital peers. ""It's our hope and our goal that we were able to create something that's compelling enough to get people excited about immersing themselves for that long of a period, with each episode being 20 minutes or so."" Patrick admits that's a long time, but stresses the importance of figuring out how to make a 360 documentary format that works for long sessions. If it turns out that the show can't keep viewers hooked for that long, The Global Gamer may fall back to a traditional format, but the immersive elements aren't going away. ""If we do end up seeing that, a 20-minute watch session for an episode is still a lot to ask of a viewer right now with the technology currently as it is, let's dial that back to a more traditional 2D and select a really great couple of shots from the shrine, or put them in the middle of a kendo battle... either way, it works for the format. It's really just kind of basing it off what the audience is ready for."" In any case, Patrick doesn't see the series ending anytime soon, even if he does tweak the format. ""At this point, gaming is an international language,"" he says. ""But the way that individual cultures choose to game really says a lot. The types of games they like to play really says a lot about their cultural backgrounds."" For Japan, the show explored the roots of Japanese culture and how that connects to rhythm games, but Patrick has plenty of other ideas -- including a look behind South Korea's thriving eSports industry , how Brazil's love of football ties into a culture built up around FIFA video games, and how Australia's strict censorship laws drastically change the gaming experience for locals. ""These stories have never been told because gaming was never really considered a serious topic of research and exploration and, quite frankly, cultural identity,"" Patrick said. The popularity of online programming around games is changing that, however. ""It's an interesting filter to look at all these different countries."" MatPat's Global Gamer can be found on The Game Theorists YouTube channel , with the first episode debuting right here on Engadget.",gaming

Thankfully, the new map won't cost players a penny, coming as a part of the game's fifth free update : 'Groundrush'. Aside from Solitude, the patch will also add more variety to Valkyrie' s Weekly Wormhole events as well as making previously competitive-only modes Carrier Assault and Control, co-op. PC owners will be pleased to hear that the patch also adds in Steam Controller support. I got to try a preview build at Fanfest, and the map added a welcome level of variety to online dogfights.

David Lumb,‘Journey to Un’Goro’ introduces 135 brand-new cards and cycles out old ones.,2017-04-06T13:41:00-04:00,First 'Hearthstone' expansion of 2017 adds dinos and adventure,"The long-awaited first expansion of 2017 for Blizzard's Hearthstone is finally here. Journey To Un'Goro adds 135 cards (gallery here ) to the game with fun new functions, but the first content of the year will also retire all of 2015's cards out of the main Standard format. That means saying goodbye to some old frenemies (adios, Ragnaros) and hello to a refreshed meta, a Wild West of untested deck concepts and synergies. A digital cardscape where dinosaurs rule. First thing's first. The new set is a promising collection with two major additions: The ""Adapt"" mechanic, which allows players to choose between three options to buff a creature, and the new ""Elementals"" group, which has tribe synergy akin to pirates and murlocs. (Some old creature cards have been retroactively rebranded and included in the new gang.) The expansion also introduces a new type of card, called ""Quests,"" which give players a powerful reward for fulfilling requirements (""play X number of Y cards/creatures,"" etc). The first expansion of the year ends Hearthstone 's Year of the Kraken and begins its Year of the Mammoth. This is the game's way of designating when certain sets rotate out of Standard format, which is restricted to only the latest cards. This isn't just great news for players eager to see some powerful decks lose their key dominant cards -- it's also dropping all cards from 2015 and replacing them with just the new cards from Un'Goro (along with a few too-popular cards from the original Classic expansion). This majorly shakes up the game balance, ushering in a refreshing period of uncertainty where players have more breathing room to try out new deck lineups and card combinations. But Year of the Mammoth isn't just cycling out old cards for new ones: As Blizzard announced in February, Hearthstone will be ditching its prior schedule alternating between 135-card expansions and small-release Adventures in favor of releasing three full-size content blocks in 2017. That's a lot more cards, meaning a lot more gameplay possibilities. But it'll also be the most expensive year for collectors yet, so completionists beware: It'll cost you about $670 to get 90 percent of this year's content if you're paying up front. That said, who knows how generous the studio plans to be for players who can't spend big bucks to enjoy all this year's fun new toys (like the brand-new Quests, which are all legendary-rarity, costing 1600 in-game dust apiece. Ahem). Blizzard also promised free Adventure-style PvE content to come, starting with the as-yet unnamed next expansion. And as indicated by the most recent patch notes and the latest designer insights video , the game's team will be increasing support for the local get-togethers, known as Fireside Gatherings, including an upcoming closed beta testing out the mysterious custom Taverns. For now, enjoy your dinosaurs.",gaming
Devindra Hardawar,Now to get some speakers on your ceiling.,2017-04-06T11:41:00-04:00,Xbox One now supports Dolby Atmos and DTS:X audio,"Just as Microsoft promised last fall, the Xbox One finally has support for next-generation audio formats like Dolby Atmos and DTS:X -- provided you have a recent home theater receiver that supports them. You just have to flip on the ""bitstream passthrough"" feature in the console's Blu-ray settings to get things going, which lets your receiver do all the audio decoding work. The big difference with Dolby Atmos and DTS:X, compared to older audio formats, is that they go beyond the traditional 5.1/7.1 speaker philosophy. Instead of sending sound to discrete channels, they're ""object-based"" formats that expand the sound field across all of your speakers. Notably, that includes speakers either mounted above you or with upward-firing capabilities that bounce sound off of your ceiling. While they're both niche formats, there are plenty of Blu-ray titles on the market that support Atmos, like Mad Max: Fury Road, Jupiter Ascending and Game of Thrones. That codec should also pair nicely with the Xbox One S's 4K Blu-ray drive, as most UHD titles also include Atmos support. And of course, it'll likely be something the upcoming Project Scorpio supports as well. Blu-ray Bitstream pass-through is now live on Xbox One consoles.

Nick Summers,The PS4 Pro has some serious competition.,2017-04-06T09:15:00-04:00,Microsoft's 'Project Scorpio' Xbox promises true 4K gaming,"If you've been wondering just how powerful Microsoft's 'Project Scorpio' Xbox will be, dream no longer. A series of pieces co-written by Eurogamer and Digital Foundry have listed the full specs for the living room console, and suffice to say it's shaping up to be a bit of a beast. Inside each system will be a CPU featuring eight custom x86 cores, clocked at 2.3 GHz, a custom GPU with 40 customised compute units clocked at 1172MHz -- an ""unprecedently high clock speed for a console,"" Eurogamer writes -- and 12GB of GDDR5 RAM. Players will also have 1TB, 2.5-inch hard drive to play around with, and a 4K UHD Blu-ray drive. Take that, PlayStation 4 Pro. So what does that mean for gaming? Well, the two outlets saw a Forza Motorsport demo running at native 4K and 60 frames per second. That doesn't mean every game will run this way -- or consistently -- but it's a promising indicator of the console's power. ""True"" 4K gaming is tricky, and the PS4 Pro isn't capable of pulling it off. (Instead, it uses an upscaling technique to leverage all of those extra pixels on your TV.) If Microsoft can deliver that level of performance across a range of software, including first and third-party offerings, it would be a huge differentiator from Sony. The reports revealed a few other interesting tidbits. The new Xbox will have an internal power supply, for instance, like the Xbox One S. It will also support Dolby Atmos and a proprietary format called HRTF, developed by the Microsoft Hololens team. That's notable because Project Scorpio will also support VR headsets, however to date Microsoft has refrained from explaining exactly how that will work. The final design, Microsoft promises, will be shown at E3 this June. There's no word on pricing, although Digital Foundry and Eurogamer are guessing it'll be around $499. Microsoft first talked about the Scorpio at last year's E3 press conference. The selling point is simple: this, Microsoft claims, will be the ""most powerful console ever,"" eclipsing the current Xbox One, PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 4 Pro. The reveal was so premature, however, that Microsoft was unable to show the hardware or any gameplay footage. Attendees had to make do with a compilation of developer endorsements, filled with buzzwords like ""innovation"" and ""no boundaries."" It was also a bold move given Microsoft announced the slimmer, HDR-ready Xbox One S at the same show, potentially overshadowing an equally important product. Project Scorpio is a bold bet by Microsoft to catch up with the PlayStation 4. Xbox One sales, from what we can tell , have been respectable -- impressive, even -- but they pale in comparison to the numbers posted by Sony. The company will be hoping that a superior home console will be enough to galavanize interest in the Xbox brand. Success will hinge on game support, however. Sony has a similar challenge with the PlayStation 4 Pro, persuading studios that it's worth supporting the higher spec sheet. Would a Scorpio-ready Halo and Gears of War be impressive? Absolutely, however those franchises might not be enough to change the company's overall momentum. At E3 this year, Microsoft's task is to show it has meaningful software to support its fancy new console this holiday.",gaming

The game will launch in a closed beta ""scheduled to begin soon"" on PS4, with the Xbox One beta coming later on. There's also an early access program on Playstation 4 that's set to begin around the end of the closed beta. Marvel hasn't yet said when Marvel Heroes Omega will launch widely, but it did reveal one piece of good news: The console version will be free-to-play. As with the PC version, however, there's an in-game currency if you want to spend (real) money on new costumes, skins and other content.",gaming
James Trew,The DRL's 2017 season debuts a souped-up quadcopter and more complex circuits.,2017-04-06T08:00:00-04:00,"ESPN's Drone Racing League returns with faster, bigger races","Last year, I asked a simple question: Can drone racing become as big as eSports? While we wait to find out, one of the leading race organizers -- the Drone Racing League -- is making all the right moves this year to make that answer yes. One of the keys to achieving that, the DRL hopes, is the introduction of the Racer3 drone, which will be the standard craft all pilots in the DRL race with. Unsurprisingly, it's more powerful and agile than its predecessor (the Racer2, obviously) and could be the shot in the arm the sport needs to go mainstream. The Racer3 should make races -- which air on ESPN starting June 20th -- even more thrilling, luring more fans (and, by association, lucre) to the game. Most hobby pilots will tell you that half of the fun is building your own quadcopter and improving it over time. In DRL races, there's one standardized drone. ""We want DRL to be the ultimate competition of piloting skill,"" the DRL's CEO, Nicholas Horbaczewski, told Engadget. But there are other benefits to a level technical playing field. ""It allows us to do things that we couldn't with homebuilt rigs -- that's everything from the way we cover the drone in bright, color-differentiating LEDs to tell them apart, to some of the engineering innovations that we can bring into it."" The innovations Horbaczewski is referring to include doubling the thrust to 16 pounds in the Racer 3, which makes it much more agile than its predecessor, allowing for tighter turns and more demanding, three-dimensional race courses. There are also more practical elements, like a polycarbonate canopy that makes the Racer3 more rugged. Sometimes one bad crash is all it takes to end a pilot's race. With the new polycarbonate hood, Horbaczewski says the Racer 3 can take more hits, and pilots can actually get right back up and keep racing, in the same way a Moto GP rider might hop back on his bike after a fall and doggedly cross the finish line. Ryan Gury, the DRL's head of product, adds, ""It also makes it a much more sexy and attractive drone,"" which might help undo the ""hobby electronics"" vibe that some outsiders associate with the sport. Aesthetics count, too. The DRL's 2016 season was picked up by ESPN (Sky in the UK), broadcasting the season's races to an audience of nearly 30 million Americans. I asked Horbaczewski if that exposure translated into bigger crowds at the events, but he tells me that that hasn't been the DRL's goal. He argues that ESPN affords them an audience that far exceeds what a full stadium would bring. You need only look at any of the race teasers to see that DRL events were almost designed for TV, with flashy neon lights and a deliberate fight-night glitz. The only problem for those budding pilots that ESPN has lured in? You won't ever be able to buy the Racer3 -- it's for DRL pilots only. ""This is not for sale, this is not a product you can buy,"" Horbaczewski told Engadget. ""We're not a consumer products company. We want to be focused on being the most elite drone circuit in the world."" That said, Horbaczewski did say the DRL has partnered with Toy State to make a more mainstream quadcopter, which should be hitting shelves this August. There are plenty of alternatives in the meantime, such as Amimon's Falcore and UVify's Draco , that offer a learning curve for beginners and near race-level performance. If the DRL, and drone racing in general, want to grow, more user-friendly products are essential. One of the sport's highest-profile pilots goes by the name Ummagawd, and when I asked him about these ""ready-to-fly"" craft for beginners, he was encouraging about their abilities: ""The tech that's going into these ready-to-fly breeds are definitely not something to take lightly. With the right pilot, they would be just as capable as the home-brewed racers."" This is reassuring for anyone who's ever searched YouTube for "" how to build a race drone."" ""There's currently still a decent barrier to entry into this sport/hobby, and I believe that's a bottleneck at the moment,"" admits Ummagawd. As for my opening question, drone racing doesn't yet have the booming revenue streams that eSports does , but that's changing. Games lend themselves to additional revenue opportunities that drones do not. League of Legends can sell endless digital Championship skins. Drone racers have to rely on contracts and prize money, or maybe put their name on a quadcopter you can buy (such as Ummagawd's popular Vortex 250 ). But it's getting there. Last year, the outright DRL winner -- a pilot named Jet -- bagged a ""six-figure"" contract. This year, even armchair pilots can snag $75,000 by winning a digital race in the DRL's PC-based drone simulator game. The money's starting to come in, though -- the DRL has a sponsorship with Allianz , and rival league DR1 has Mountain Dew. But the job title ""Pro drone racer"" is a very elite club right now. Perhaps a better parallel for the sport today is skateboarding in the '80s and '90s. The largely underground activity attracts a dedicated following where riches and fame are not realistic goals, meaning that only the hardcore who love it enough persist. Their creativity and enthusiasm spawned an empire. Early skateboarders also earned money primarily through sales of their pro-model boards and competition winnings. Tony Hawk might be a multi-millionaire now, but there was a time when his team manager (and '70s skate legend) Stacy Peralta cut him a royalties check for 85 cents , so heterodox was the sport at the time. Of course, skateboarding is now fully in the mainstream, and eSports is thriving -- no doubt a story arc the DRL is hoping its sport will follow. The Drone Racing League's 2017 kicks off on ESPN at 8pm on June 20th.",gaming

Jon Fingas,New York City FC now has a representative for virtual tournaments.,2017-04-05T18:53:00-04:00,Major League Soccer gets its first eSports player,"A number of European soccer teams have their own eSports players , but what about American clubs? Don't worry, they're catching up. New York City FC has signed Major League Sports' first eSports player, Christopher Holly, to represent the outfit in FIFA tournaments. He's definitely not a newcomer to the game -- Holly has been playing some form of FIFA on PlayStation systems for the past 12 years, and plays well enough that he was the top-rated FIFA Ultimate Team player on the planet in December. The signing isn't coming out of the blue. The same group that owns NYC FC also owns Manchester City, which recruited its first eSports player last year. And the reasons are almost certainly the same: eSports serves as both a promo tool and, in the long run, a source of revenue. For Major League Soccer, it's more important than usual. Soccer doesn't get nearly the same attention in the US as it does elsewhere in the world, after all.

The only speaker your living room needs Sonos Playbase review As with most everything Sonos does, the Playbase is both excellent and expensive, according to Nathan Ingraham. It might not be for everyone, but the combination of top-notch sound quality, versatility and simple setup makes it an extremely compelling speaker for the living room. The next one will be a 'complete rethink.' Apple is sorry about the Mac Pro The last new Mac Pro was announced back in 2013, and not much has changed much since. The iconic shiny object proved a difficult fit for its pro users, and as a consequence, Apple is apparently fundamentally rethinking its top-end computer series and everything that comes with it. You won't see any of these products for a while, however. That's because Apple's engineering team is apparently still working to design a system that can easily and efficiently be upgraded -- the biggest issue many had with the current Mac Pro.

It's called Crash Override , just like the volunteer group she founded to support harassment victims, and it's now ready for pre-order. As GamerGate's original target, the game developer had to endure having her accounts hacked, her sensitive photos stolen and her family and friends doxxed and harassed. She was also on the receiving end of numerous murder and rape threats. Quinn's book talks about her GamerGate experience in its first few chapters, but it sounds like it has much more to offer. "" Crash Override "", its summary reads, ""offers an up close look inside the controversy, threats, and social and cultural battles that started in the far corners of the internet and have since permeated our online lives."" The rest of the book focuses on Quinn's work with the tech industry and the government to make the internet a safer place. She discusses what she and her partners have done thus far to curb online harassment, which of their efforts worked and which didn't. To make the book useful on a more personal level, she also included practical guides on what to do if you're getting a lot of online hate.

Andrew Dalton,Volunteer 'Steam Explorers' will be tasked with sorting through the platform's catalog.,2017-04-04T21:44:00-04:00,Valve only wants to sell you good games,"As Steam continues to grow its expansive catalog, Valve is still figuring out how to separate the quality titles and undiscovered indie hits from the legions of mediocre games that are only designed to make a quick buck. The platform is already replacing its community-focused Greenlight program with the new Steam Direct service to help Valve clean up the sea of what it calls ""fake games,"" but it still doesn't solve the problem of surfacing the really good stuff. To combat that problem, Valve is proposing a new system of ""Steam Explorers"" who will play their way through queues of undiscovered games and flag their favorites to give them a bump in the rankings. The proposed system was described to two YouTubers and vocal critics of Steam during an in-person meeting at Valve Headquarters, which Kotaku has helpfully summarized here. But the meat of it is essentially a two-tiered revamp of the Curators Program that will happen around the same time as the launch of Steam Direct. As Ars Technica reports , Curators will soon be able to build top ten lists, embed their own game videos and use some extra search functions to help them sift through the games catalog. Developers will also be able to contact Curators directly through the platform, which should curb some of the attempted fraud that has popped up in the past. Finally, Curators will get insights and analytics about how their links affect game sales and there's a chance Valve may give kickbacks to the most active or influential users in the program. Sponsored Curators have been a problem for the platform in the past, but as Kotaku points out, this last feature has the potential to backfire if curators start to skew (consciously or not) their recommendations towards more popular games -- defeating the purpose of curation in the first place. The Explorers program, on the other hand, will be open for anyone to sign up and will come with its own set of forums for sharing favorite titles and setting up multiplayer matches. The combination of algorithmic discovery and Explorer approval is meant to help surface unknown titles, but as others have already pointed out, it could still be vulnerable to the same vote-hacking problems that plagued Greenlight. None of these features are set in stone yet, so it should be noted that Valve could tweak any of them at any point. Most promising perhaps: Valve plans to start giving regular users more data about the games they're seeing and why they are being given a particular recommendation. It's not complete transparency, but will finally give users a better look inside Steam's notorious black box.",gaming

Tom Regan,You can now buy games directly from the Amazon-owned company mid-stream.,2017-04-04T16:35:00-04:00,Twitch starts selling the games it streams,"We already new Twitch planned to start selling its viewers a selection of PC games directly through the streaming site. Starting today, the service allows users to purchase a variety of different titles from the site while watching related streams. Over the next week, around 50 games and various add-ons will be available to purchase mid-stream, including Ubisoft's recent big hitters -- For Honor and Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon: Wildlands. As well as simply selling their games at full price, developers can also use the service to award fans with special offers for watching streams at certain times. It's not just developers who will benefit from selling games, however, with partnered Twitch streamers also set to earn 5% of sales generated through their channels. Opting to bypass Steam completely, games bought through the site can be downloaded and played through the Twitch Desktop App. Alternatively, users can opt to load games through existing publisher specific game launchers like Uplay. In a bid to get viewers to choose Twitch over the competition, the streaming site is rewarding buyers with free Twitch Crates. These digital boxes will award recipients with a randomized drop of items, including exclusive emotes, chat badges and Bits for Cheering. To entice initial purchases, until the end of April buyers will be entered into a raffle -- giving them the chance to win $500 worth of pro streaming gear. While the move certainly makes sense, having streamers take a cut of game sales arguably blurs the line between genuine content and paid advertisements. With partnered streamers more likely to make more from the big releases, this could see many content creators streaming games purely to make a buck rather than to entertain viewers. With many YouTubers caught up in similarly shady practices , Twitch will have to moderate partner streams carefully if they want to keep content feeling genuine.",gaming

Zach Hines,It's much more about the joy of discovery than it is about the conquest and exploitation of a digital landscape.,2017-04-04T12:00:00-04:00,'Zelda: Breath of the Wild' makes open-world games exciting again,"At this point, The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild has become a video-game phenomenon. Much has been said about how it's a new take on the dusty old Zelda formula, or on how it represents a fresh direction for Nintendo in general, by buoying its new Switch console. But Breath of the Wild deserves just as much credit for how it subverts and reaffirms the power of the open world. There are two key hallmarks of the open-world genre: There is a big map to freely traverse, and there's a lot of stuff to do on that map. It's a formula that's been refined over the past few iterations of Grand Theft Auto , Assassin's Creed , Elder Scrolls and Far Cry , among others of that ilk. Over time, these open worlds have become increasingly cluttered with gameplay to-dos: waypoints, mini-games, races, collectibles, camps to clear and chunks of the map to color in. The result is that they tend to blend together into a mélange of similar gameplay beats. The location itself ends up becoming secondary: Whether you're in steampunk London or in GTA 's funhouse version of Hollywood, you're basically chasing the same waypoints and obsessively collecting the same shiny thingies. But Breath of the Wild dumps most of this typically calcified open world stuff, and replaces it with a different kind of video-game pleasure: the joy of exploration. So much of Breath of the Wild is, for me, finding a route up a cliff face, or stopping to watch the sunrise, or just listening to the whistle of the wind and the scurry of critters in the brush. Breath of the Wild sets the stage for this meditative experience first and foremost through its map. It's clear and functional, complete with useful topographic rings (contrast that against, say, Horizon Zero Dawn 's colorful but unhelpful paint smear). The map is also, at first, blessedly free of icons; aside from the odd waypoint, the only markings on it are the ones you choose to put there yourself. (I should note that I've chosen to turn off the mini map.) The seemingly minor decision to restrict what the map communicates -- which at first feels like it's grating against common practice -- was a fundamentally crucial one that puts the player into the exploratory mind-set. This is not a game in which you chase a glowing chest icon. Instead, this is a game in which you discover an interesting geographical feature on your map and then have to find a way to get there, only to discover it leads to a puzzle you can't quite solve right now. So you mark the location with a ""star"" to come back to later. After several hours of exploration, you've charted out a chunk of the world. Your map isn't a long Ubisoft-style to-do list; instead, it's a record of where you've been and a reminder of places to return. Traversal is the key gameplay mechanic in Breath of the Wild -– even more than the combat mechanic. The stamina wheel gamifies the traversal process: Because stamina is a finite resource, the player is forced to plan a route and make decisions on the fly about how she is going to reach an interesting point she's staked out on the map. The traversal mechanic also cleverly interacts with the robust weather, temperature and physics systems to both aid and undermine you. Oh, you can't ascend this mountain anymore because it's raining and now the surface is slippery. Maybe wait out the weather, or glide over to another peak to find a better route. Wait, you can catch an updraft from this side of the canyon and get yourself halfway there. This satisfying interlocking of mechanics and systems keep the focus of the game on the open world of Hyrule itself. And what a world it is. All the clever maps and polished traversal mechanics would mean nothing if it weren't a world worth exploring. But Hyrule is bristling with clever secrets and gems tucked away in the landscape. Nintendo has always been adept at this kind of touch -- be it scattering heart pieces around in Ocarina of Time , one of its first major ""open worlds,"" or even just putting hidden blocks in Super Mario Bros. -- but it's on supercharge here in Breath of the Wild. There always seems to be another puzzle, another blastable wall, another village or another Shrine just over the horizon. Several other small but crucial decisions keep the exploration engaging. The lilting, unobtrusive music is secondary to the soundscape of nature: The whistling wind and the occasional whip-poor-will take precedent over a manipulative orchestral score, enhancing the sense of place. Nintendo also made a smart decision to give many of the natural features formal names, visible once you've unlocked that section of the map. Even little copses have enticing names (like ""Midla Woods"" or ""Bubinga Forest""), though they may not reward you with anything more significant than a Korok seed ( Breath of the Wild 's sole version of the Ubisoft collectible). Sometimes a forest might not have anything more notable than interesting bugs hidden under the brush -- not unlike actual real-life forests. Thematically, this creates a meditative feel to Breath of the Wild 's open world. Because of how their maps are designed and how their gameplay systems interlock, most open-world games end up with a colonialist bent to them, with Mass Effect: Andromeda and Ghost Recon: Wildlands being two high-profile recent examples. In Wildlands , you're stalking the landscape to hunt and kill the evil locals lurking behind the waypoints. In Andromeda , you're harvesting resources from your maps to, literally, feed your colony. But there are very few of these exploitative metrics in Breath of the Wild ; even after dozens of hours exploring Hyrule, all you've gained is knowledge of the land (and some critters in your pouch). Even the enemies, which are set up in the game's fiction as demonic spirits, will respawn and repopulate. Hyrule is, ultimately, untamable. All you can manage to do is know it. In this way, Breath of the Wild ends up sharing more with ""walking-simulator"" games than with the likes of Far Cry. At times, it feels much like ""Proteus,"" an early walking simulator that leans heavily on discovery. The burgeoning walking sim genre receives a lot of flak from the wider gaming community, but if Breath of the Wild is placed in the pantheon of that genre — perhaps as its apogee — it reveals just how much zen-like wonderment these fantastic, impossible digital landscapes can provide. Breath of the Wild is exactly the kind of open-world that video games sorely need: an expansive, hand-crafted landscape there to be observed and discovered rather than conquered.",gaming

The gaming giant has revealed that Naughty Dog's PS2-era Jak and Daxter games ( The Precursor Legacy , Jak II , Jak 3 and Jak X: Combat Racing ) will be available on the PS4 as a download later in 2017. Don't get your hopes up for a Crash Bandicoot -style makeover, though. They'll be rendered at 1080p and support modern features like Remote Play and trophies, but they won't receive graphical overhauls or any new features. If you want to duke it out with a friend in Jak X , you'll have to share a TV. The relatively modest conversion effort isn't surprising. Naughty Dog has its hands full with The Last of Us Part II and, to a lesser extent, Uncharted: The Lost Legacy. And while third parties can certainly handle remasters (Vicarious Visions is largely responsible for the Crash re-do), overhauling four games is no mean feat.

Recode sources understand that Apple is pitching a deal that would offer HBO , Showtime and Starz for one price. It's not certain whether or not you'd get a discount over the $35 per month it costs to subscribe to each network individually, but the focus would be on convenience.

Maradona has threatened to sue Konami for allegedly using his likeness in the game without permission. We've reached out to Konami for its side of the conversation, but it's reasonable to presume that this could get messy if a lawsuit goes ahead. That seems likely when Maradona's lawyer, Matias Morla, has vowed to ""crack down"" on the PES2017 developer. Video game licenses for athletes have been a thorny subject for years, and it's seldom just a matter of signing an agreement and calling it a day. You frequently have to worry about faces, names and jersey numbers as separate concerns, and a misstep can cost you dearly. Even using tattoos without permission can get you into trouble. It's possible that Konami thought it was abiding by the rules and still didn't get Maradona's full permission, assuming this is anything more than a simple misunderstanding. Update: Konami has issued a statement to Kotaku , saying that ""our company is using [this player] appropriately, with the basis of the license within the contract.""

Jon Fingas,The production company behind 'Pitch Perfect' is involved.,2017-04-01T23:03:00-04:00,Survival horror game 'We Happy Few' is becoming a movie,"Video game movies tend to struggle in part because of their stories. What sounds good for an adventure or first-person shooter can fall flat when you're asked to construct a cinematic narrative around it. However, you might get something better this time around. Variety has learned that We Happy Few , Compulsion Games' paranoia-fueled tale of an English town gone terribly wrong, is becoming a movie. The company behind the Pitch Perfect movies, Gold Circle Entertainment, is working with dj2 Entertainment (also working on the Sleeping Dogs movie ) to make it a reality. There's still a lot up in the air. The team doesn't even have writers, let alone a cast. Compulsion believes the producers have good ideas for maintaining the ""menace, dark humor and central themes"" of the survival horror title, however, and dj2 says it'll stay ""true to the source material"" while including a few surprises. There's good reason to be skeptical, since game-based movies only rarely get top-flight screenwriting and acting talent. However, We Happy Few at least has a concept that's well-suited to the big screen. Its alternate history plot, where people are forced to take a mind-altering drug to hide a sinister truth, shares something common with popular movies that revolve around the "" town with a dark secret"" premise -- think The Wicker Man or even Hot Fuzz. That's a good platform to build on, then. The big challenge is evoking the spirit of those classics without either being overly derivative or diluting what makes the game special.",gaming

Actually, by the company's standards, Wednesday's Galaxy S8 launch in New York was fairly tame: There was no orchestra onstage, and attendees looking for VR headsets underneath their seats were left empty-handed. Instead, we got the heavily leaked Galaxy S8 (and S8+) , along with a healthy dose of humility -- yes, Samsung is still very sorry about those exploding Note 7s. All told, the phones themselves look promising, with nearly bezel-less displays that make the devices easier to hold than their 5.8- and 6.2-inch screen sizes would have you believe. Samsung's face-recognizing personal assistant Bixby looks interesting too, though we're gonna call BS on the company's pitch that these devices represent a fresh form factor for phones -- they're still just boxes, guys.

Sean Buckley,Nintendo Switch's NFC controllers forced 'Skylanders' to grow up,2017-03-31T18:00:00-04:00,'Skylanders' learns what Amiibo knew all along: Drop the portal,"The paradigm for toys-to-life games is well-established: one part kid-friendly video game, one part expensive, collectible figurines -- and a tethered NFC ""portal"" that ties them together. When Skylanders: Spyro's Adventure introduced this model in 2011, it sparked a new genre in gaming -- bringing about the rise and fall of Disney Infinity , the nostalgic brand licensing of LEGO Dimensions and even inspired Nintendo to launch its own line of NFC gaming collectibles. In fact, with the exception of Nintendo, all of these brands followed Skylanders ' tethered-portal model. On the Nintendo Switch, however, the game that started it all is taking the Amiibo approach. If you buy Skylanders Imaginators on the Nintendo Switch, it won't come with the series' iconic ""Portal of Power"" peripheral. Instead, the game piggybacks off the NFC technology Nintendo built into the console's controllers. Rather than placing characters on a wired base to transmit figurine data into the game, players merely need to tap their Skylander toys against the thumbstick on the right-hand Joy-Con. That's it. No more setting up a USB peripheral every time you want to play the game or making sure it's in reach of the couch. Instead, you just tap and play. Easy. Although this is a simple, straightforward change that seems like a long overdue evolution of the toys-to-life experience, it wasn't really something that could be done until now. Not because the technology didn't exist, but because it wasn't available on most platforms. Neither the Xbox One or PlayStation 4 have built-in NFC readers, and only one of the Wii U's controllers (the included GamePad) supported the feature. The Switch is the first console to standardize NFC communication in every controller configuration. Finding another way to scan in the Skylanders toys was also necessary to serve players who use the Switch in portable mode. While it's certainly easier to play Skylanders without the cumbersome portal accessory , its absence fundamentally changes the game into a more traditional experience. Changing characters in Skylanders typically meant placing a figure on the portal and leaving it there -- but after you scan a character into the Nintendo Switch version of the game, you don't even need the figure anymore. Scanning a toy more than once turns it into an ""Instant Skylander"" that can be summoned from the game's menu at any time. This is perfect for players who want to take the game on the go without toting a bunch of toys, but it calls the entire concept of the series into question. If you can scan your figures once and play the game without them, does Skylanders even need a toy component? Technically, the game could get away without the physical toys, although that's not the point. For Skylanders (and other toys-to-life) fans, collecting is part of the fun, and the developer isn't offering any toy-free options at this time. The portal-free approach doesn't work for all toys-to-life games, either -- LEGO Dimensions features several puzzles that require players to move toys to different portions of its connected figure base, a gameplay element that wouldn't work with the Nintendo Switch's single NFC touchpoint. Still, for Skylanders Imaginators , the change feels like a massive improvement, and a lot like the Amiibo system it's piggybacking off. By making the figures a little less necessary, Skylanders on Switch now comes close to mirroring Nintendo's toy-optional approach to the genre. It's a less tedious experience. It's still probably not the future of the Skylanders franchise, though.There are far too many figures and portals left over from previous games to expect Activision to nix the conceit of the series on other platforms. But if you're looking for a more minimalist toys-to-life experience, it can be had on the Nintendo Switch.",gaming

They will be streamed online, or you can buy tickets and watch in person. There teams from the top 32 countries will battle it out, with the top two automatically qualifying to compete live at BlizzCon 2017 in November. It's all very simple, right?",gaming
Jessica Conditt,"Don't worry, PS4 and Xbox One players -- you're getting Bungie's big sequel, too.",2017-03-30T14:11:00-04:00,'Destiny 2' brings the interstellar MMO grind to PC in September,"Destiny 2 will hit PC, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One on September 8th, much to the delight of wannabe space hunters worldwide. The original Destiny was console-only, leaving PC players in the lurch, but pre-orders for the sequel went live today and confirmed the new game is coming to desktop. Destiny 2 is a completely new title, meaning any progress that players made in the original game will not carry over to the sequel. This is good news for newcomers, PC players or otherwise, as it places every person on equal footing from the get-go. However, it's a bit of a blow to anyone who's spent the past three years grinding with their Guardian (not like that, you pervs). Note that PS4 folks will have a bit of an advantage over players on other platforms: The console is getting ""exclusive content"" that won't show up on Xbox One or PC until fall 2018 at the earliest. Destiny 2 comes in a variety of flavors, including the Collector's Edition (which features a convertible backpack capable of carrying a 15 inch laptop), the Limited Edition (access to the first two expansion packs and a fancy display box), and the Digital Deluxe Edition (the expansion pass and extra in-game content). Nathan Fillion once again stars as the Hunter Vanguard Cayde-6 in the latest trailer for Destiny 2 , but this time around he's sharing the screen with the more composed character, Commander Zavala.",gaming
Devindra Hardawar,,2017-03-30T13:25:00-04:00,'Rock Band VR' is the dorkiest game ever and I love it,"Rock Band VR will make you feel like a rock star. But from the outside, you'll look like a crazy person with an Oculus Rift on your head and a plastic guitar in your hands, strumming along in silence. Basically, you'll look like a huge dork while playing it. But the embarrassment is worth it: Rock Band VR successfully captures the feeling of actually playing music in front of a crowd. Even though it's Harmonix's first stab at virtual reality, the end result is immersive and, most importantly, fun. While music games are still around -- Rock Band 4 was released in 2015 -- it's clear that their heyday is over. Guitar Hero brought plastic guitars into living rooms around the world, and the Rock Band series did the same with more instruments (a drum kit, keyboard and microphone). But given that it's been more than a decade since the first Guitar Hero debuted, it was about time we saw a new spin on music games. The biggest issue with Rock Band VR is getting started. To play it, you'll need an Oculus Rift and Touch Controllers ($600 bundled together), a gaming PC rig and a Rock Band 4 guitar. Harmonix is selling bundles of the game along with an Xbox One or PS4 guitar for $70, which is useful if, like me, you've already dumped all of your plastic gaming instruments. You'll also need to slot an Oculus Touch controller on top of the guitar for motion tracking. Oculus includes a small dock for Rock Band guitars with every Touch controller, but hopefully it will also be sold separately. Since I wasn't planning to review Rock Band VR when I first set up the Touch Controllers last year, I completely lost track of that dock. You can, however, still play the game by letting the Touch controller sit at the base of the guitar neck. Unfortunately, despite being called Rock Band VR , the game only supports guitar play right now. There's also no multiplayer support yet, though there's room for that to be added down the line. On top of being a virtual reality experience that lets you see your bandmates and a crowd in front of you, Rock Band VR completely reinvents how you play Rock Band. Instead of trying to hit different notes during a song, it's focused entirely on playing different chords. That involves holding down chord keys and strumming on a guitar rather than trying to hit colored buttons. It's a far less punishing experience than previous games. In fact, it's pretty much impossible to fail a song. Even if you do badly, you just earn fewer points. But while it might seem like a cakewalk at first, there's a learning curve if you want to play the game properly. It takes time to learn different chord combos, which helps you score higher. And there are higher-difficulty settings that introduce things like chord progression. Ultimately, it's much more fulfilling than just hitting notes in sync with a song. (If you miss the old gameplay format, you can get your fix in ""classic mode."") I found myself jamming out for hours at a time, whereas earlier Rock Band and Guitar Hero games have left me frustrated after failing songs. More than any other title from Harmonix, Rock Band VR lets you live out the fantasy of actually being a rocker -- especially during the crazy guitar-shredding solos. It even gives you extra points for head banging! The game is an ideal VR experience: The creepy virtual audience actually makes eye contact with you and gets revved up as you play better, and the chord chart appears right above the crowd. There's also something cool about being onstage alongside virtual bandmates. You can also lean into any mic onstage to speak to the audience or follow along with a song. Still, Rock Band VR shares most of the downsides of virtual reality too. It's a lot harder to enjoy with an audience, since you're experiencing it in a headset with headphones. You can always configure the sound to come out of your speakers and show off the game window on a TV or monitor, but that works best if you somehow have the Oculus Rift set up in your living room. The game ships with 60 songs from the likes of Aerosmith, David Bowie and DragonForce, and as usual, you'll eventually be able to snag more through DLC. There are plenty of solid bundled tracks for rock fans, though depending on your tastes, there are likely a few you'll never play. And no, you can't bring over your existing Rock Band song library. For all of its faults, Rock Band VR succeeds by getting the big things right. It completely revitalizes the aging music-game genre, and it's one of the first titles I'd recommend to anyone with an Oculus Rift. It lets you live out all of your teenage musical fantasies -- as long as you don't mind looking like a huge geek.",gaming

For one thing, id Software is promising that the game will play at 120Hz as a pean to pro gamers. After all, faster frame rates equal faster reaction times, the sort of thing that professionals obsess about. Quake Champions ' creators also have designs on cornering the lucrative, and massive, amateur esports market with the game. By making it free to play-ish , combined with the strength of the Quake brand, it should swamp those gaming cafes in eastern Europe and South Korea.

In a move set to please PlayStation owners, Double Fine has announced that it's bringing the beautiful puzzler GNOG to PS4 and PSVR on May 2nd. Developed as a collaboration between toy maker Samuel Boucher and Canadian art collective Ko_Op, this stunningly realized puzzle game sees players exploring a strange world of interconnected heads. With an achingly cool soundtrack complementing GNOG 's gorgeous visuals, players are tasked with solving various physics-based puzzles as they attempt to find their way to each head's exit. With games often living and dying by their mechanics, it's refreshing to see a game from a studio that's led by artists. Known for its graphic design work and interactive art experiences for Canada's National Film Board, Ko_Op's flair for striking design has given GNOG a captivating style. Thankfully, it looks like GNOG has more to offer than just its eye-catching aesthetic. With each of the game's heads containing their own unique universe and their own rules, players will have to use everything from Rubik-cube style problem solving to time manipulation if they are to make it to the next puzzle. Currently, there are no details on how the game will work in PSVR. Still, with Sony's VR headset's software lineup still woefully lacking in big hitters , the game is certain to be a welcome addition to the platform's library regardless. GNOG is available to preorder now from the PlayStation Store for $14.99 (or $13.49 for PS Plus members) and will be coming to Steam and iOS at a later date.",gaming

And seemingly in an effort to keep streamers healthy, there are a few tools in the back-end to remind folks to do things like eat and stretch. Simply check the ""Enable Health Reminders"" box and at a user-defined intervals you can get pings to stand up and shove some food in your face. Of course, Beam isn't the first to incorporate this sort of thing. The Apple Watch, for example, has activity reminders. Given how bad for you sitting can be, and how easy it is to lose track of time while at a computer in general, not just hosting a stream, it's good to see Microsoft address this.

Stefanie Fogel,"Hello, Loot Chests!",2017-03-29T16:40:00-04:00,Blizzard puts a smidge of 'Overwatch' in 'Heroes of the Storm',"Blizzard is working hard to overhaul its free-to-play multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) Heroes of the Storm. The studio has announced some big changes are coming in the game's 2.0 update, including a new reward system similar to Blizzard's hugely popular online shooter, Overwatch. ""This is the next stage in the game's growth,"" Heroes of the Storm Game Director Alan Dabiri said in a developer update posted on YouTube today. ""Heroes 2.0 reflects everything we've been building towards since launch, as well as our current design philosophy and a bunch of extensive plans for future content."" Previously, players earned in-game gold or cosmetic character skins by reaching certain milestone levels. Now, they'll receive a Loot Chest every time they level up. As in Overwatch , the chests will be separated into three categories -- Common, Rare and Epic -- and each type is guaranteed to award at least one item of that rarity or higher. Additionally, players will get hero-specific chests for every 10 levels they gain with a particular character. Impatient players who don't want to wait for level-ups can always buy chests through the game menu. Of course, if you're going to have Loot Chests, they need to have loot in them. Blizzard is also adding more cosmetic items to the game, including sprays, emojis, portraits and voice lines. Shards, also gained through chests and duplicate items, allow you to craft specific cosmetics to add to your collection. The 2.0 update's other big change is to Heroes of the Storm's progression system. Before, it was too easy to gain early levels, and later levels felt like a slog. The patch changes all of that by slightly increasing the experience needed during the first few levels, then reducing the amount needed to progress later by approximately 75 to 80 percent. Blizzard is also removing the Player and Hero Level caps. Your Player Level will now be the sum of all Hero levels, so whenever you gain a new Hero level, your overall Player Level will increase too. ""Uncapping progression helps us accomplish our goals to make progression more frequent and more meaningful,"" Blizzard said in a Battle.net post. Blizzard is holding a month-long beta to test the changes. They will go live on April 25th.",gaming

The game's publisher, Funcom , plans to relaunch the game as a free-to-play ""shared-world action RPG,"" no doubt hoping to cash in on the original title's recognition while updating the title for a modern audience. Secret World Legends will launch with the same original eight levels of creepy, supernatural content as the original MMO, with the rest of the environments, dungeons and stories from The Secret World following soon. Funcom also plans to create original content for the new game in the near future. All content will be free, though things like extra character slots and more weapon storage will cost you. If you're still invested in The Secret World MMO, you can continue to play, as the new title will exist on its own server. If you want to start over in the new game but keep any customizations you earned in the first title, there will be a transfer system in place.

The March update centers around a redesigned interface that's designed for speed above all else. It's quicker to perform more than a few tasks, such as finding a group to join. The revamped Guide should be much quicker, too -- it promises faster access to recent apps, background music controls and game recording. A few tweaks are designed with multitasking in mind, such as a brand new achievement tracker and a Cortana rework that puts the voice assistant into an overlay that won't disrupt what you're doing. There is one immediate drawback to all this: the console's signature Snap mode is going away. You may not miss it too much (how often do you run apps side by side on your TV?), but there's a good chance you'll notice. OF course, it's not just about the front end. The Xbox One now has built-in Beam streaming , letting you broadcast your gaming adventures using Microsoft's in-house service instead of Twitch. Gameplay is also more accessible thanks to a Copilot feature that splits controls between controllers. Media junkies will like support for Blu-ray player bitstream passthrough (to have a receiver decode audio), and parents can set screen time for their kids through a web interface.

Devindra Hardawar,The mobile Oculus Home experience is also getting some upgrades.,2017-03-29T11:00:00-04:00,Samsung's new Gear VR and controller arrive on April 21st for $129,"While the VR war between the Oculus Rift and HTC Vive is getting most of the hype, the competition in mobile VR is a far bigger deal for most consumers. After all, you only need a phone and a cheap headset for mobile VR, not a powerful gaming rig and lots of spending money. Samsung's Gear VR cemented itself as a pioneer in the market over the past few years, but Google's Daydream View headset came out swinging last year with the inclusion of a small motion-sensing remote. Samsung is ready to fight back with a refined headset and mobile motion controller of its own. As part of its Galaxy S8 event today, Samsung announced that the new Gear VR will be available on April 21st for $129. Current Gear VR owners can also nab the controller separately for $39. While the Gear VR is still far less than the $600 you'd have to shell out for the Oculus Rift or Vive, it's more than the $80 price for either the previous model or the Daydream View. But Samsung might be able to justify that premium with a slightly better mobile VR experience. I had a chance to try out the new controller with an older Gear VR, and I was surprised by how comfortable it was. The motion tracking felt fairly accurate, but mostly I was struck by how it felt in my hand. It has a slightly angled orientation, and your fingers naturally fall on the large trackpad on top and the trigger button on the back. That trigger, by the way, differentiates it from the Daydream View remote, which only has a trackpad and a few buttons. It makes the controller more in line with the Oculus Touch and Vive gamepads, and it's a big help for most VR shooting titles. Beyond the new hardware, Oculus also updated its Oculus Home experience for the Gear VR. It boots up much faster than before, so you're not left staring at a black screen when you put on the headset. You'll also notice that Oculus Home looks much clearer than it did in the past. It's now easier to read text, thanks to a doubled pixel resolution. To show that feature off, Oculus also added a VR web browser, which was able to render Engadget and other major websites with no issue. Most importantly, the website text looked good enough to read within the Gear VR.",gaming

These are not fancy HDR-equipped OLED or quantum dot models, but they do have full-array LED backlighting, built-in WiFi and Vizio's own smart TV system for apps like Netflix. Comparing the price against premium sets from established TV players like LG, Samsung and Sony, and you can see how Vizio might expect to sell plenty of 'em. Nothing to see here. US House votes to roll back FCC privacy rules The FCC just tried to implement privacy rules that would prevent ISPs from selling personal info like your browsing history without asking, but Congress is putting a stop to that. In a 215 to 205 vote, the House of Representatives approved S J Res 34, following a vote by the Senate last week. Now, if the president signs it into law -- as he says he will -- ISPs won't have to deal with these extra privacy and vulnerability disclosure rules nationwide. Customers will still have to opt-out of any sales of their data, assuming they can figure out how to do it. No colors, yet. IKEA launches its own low-cost smart lighting range Philips is perhaps the most well known smart bulb maker, but that could soon change thanks to a new entrant: IKEA. That's right, the world's biggest furniture chain is today debuting its own smart lighting range in the UK. As you might expect, the prices are a lot easier on the wallet. Its Smart Lighting collection consists of TRÅDFRI LED bulbs and remote control, a gateway kit, a motion sensor kit, dimming lights and a selection of LED light panels and doors that can be built into kitchen and bedroom cabinets -- enough to light up most homes, but only in differing shades of white.

If you're one of those fans, you won't have long to wait to relieve that experience on modern hardware. Beamdog, Hasbro and Wizards of the Coast have revealed that they're launching Planescape: Torment Enhanced Edition on April 11th. As with most better remastering efforts , this involves more than a little spit and polish to make the game run on newer hardware. The rework polishes the game with a 4K-friendly interface on Macs and Windows PCs, a remastered soundtrack and interface tweaks (such as area zooming and quick looting) that reflect 18 years of progress. It even has the help of lead Torment designer Chris Avellone, who's curating various fixes and upgrades to create his ideal vision of the game. This is also the first version of the RPG built for mobile, with both Android and iOS versions arriving the same day. Suffice it to say that you'll want a tablet if you go that route, since there's a lot of info to juggle at the same time. Beamdog is releasing the computer versions of Planescape through its own store, GOG, the Mac App Store and Steam for $20. On mobile, you'll be paying $10 through either the App Store or Google Play. We'd say the price is reasonable in either case. Beamdog estimates that a typical playthrough will last for 50 or more hours, and there's a distinct chance you'll be happy whether you're nostalgic for Torment or just want to sink your teeth into a classic Dungeons & Dragons experience.",gaming

The short has the voice actor's character, the wisecracking quest-giver Cayde-6 from the first Destiny , jawing on about this one time he shot up some dudes. Everything is pretty, including the rubble. If you take anything from this teaser, enjoy the spiffed-up graphics. Otherwise, they've nothing to announce -- but Sony does. Apparently, the sequel won't follow the first game's lead in keeping its console-exclusive content permanently, well, exclusive. If Destiny 2 really launches on all platforms in September, PS4 owners will get a year of bragging rights before its extra content also comes to Xbox One in Fall 2018, as confirmed in the last few seconds of the PlayStation YouTube channel's version of the teaser. Not that we know what that content is yet, but boy, those Sony kids will have it.",gaming
Sean Buckley,Nintendo's new shooter makes for truly mobile multiplayer gaming.,2017-03-28T15:10:00-04:00,Playing 'Splatoon 2' over LTE won't kill your data plan,"When Nintendo first revealed its new game console back in October , it chose to end the device's teaser trailer with a shot of a packed arena cheering an esports team. Its game of choice was Splatoon 2 for Nintendo Switch. The scene represented two things: Nintendo staking a claim in the competitive gaming space and a promise that the new console's portability would allow gamers to take that competitive online experience on the road. I put the latter half of that pledge to the test during last week's Global Testfire preview , and it held up better than I ever imagined. I didn't recreate the trailer's Splatoon 2 segment shot for shot. The game's Testfire preview didn't have local multiplayer that I could use to strategize with teammates, and I certainly didn't take my console to an arena to compete in a spectator match. But I was caught outside of my house during one of the preview weekend's blocks of playable time. As an avid fan of the series, I was eager to sneak in a quick round of Turf War, but there was no reliable WiFi in the area. Desperate, I tethered my Switch to my phone's hotspot and braced myself for the inevitable notification telling me I'd gone over my data allowance for the month. The overage notification never came. It turns out that a single round of Splatoon 2 multiplayer barely eats up any data. When my first round of LTE-powered multiplayer ended, I pulled up Project Fi's usage statistics. My three-minute game burned through a mere 0.011 gigabytes of data -- a little over 10 megabytes. That rate stayed more or less consistent through my second, third and fourth rounds, taking just 45.6 megabytes from my data budget for 20 minutes of online play (including time spent in matchmaking). While that's not a completely negligible amount of data, it's small enough to make a few mobile rounds manageable. The entire experience felt like something that shouldn't work. Splatoon 2 was not only light on my data plan but also didn't play with any noticeable lag. Despite the higher latency of the LTE connection (compared to my cable home internet), my game ran smoothly, with no rubber banding, missed hits or sync issues. This is partially because LTE in my area is particularly strong, but Splatoon is also well suited to tolerating higher latency connections, as game modes task players with painting the game's environment more than attacking other players. As neat as it was to play a multiplayer ""home console"" shooter on the go, Splatoon 2 's data usage isn't technically out of the ordinary. According to mobile hotspot manufacturer Kita Enterprises , the average multiplayer game eats up about 17.5kb/s, or a little over one megabyte per minute. The rate varies from game to game. Battlefield 4 might hit that target , but MMO-like games like Destiny will demand a little more data. Any game on the lower end of the spectrum, like Splatoon 2 , can theoretically be played over LTE without doing too much damage to your cellular bill -- but until now, there hasn't been much of a reason to use a mobile hotspot with a game console. Before the Nintendo Switch, console multiplayer games simply weren't portable. Nintendo's successes are often tied to novelty. The novelty of motion controls. The novelty of a touchscreen. The novelty of 3D. For the Nintendo Switch, that novel experience is the ability to take your home console with you and play it anywhere. I fully expected Splatoon 2's online multiplayer to spoil the magic of the console's portability, but I was wrong. I doubt it was intentional, but the game's low data requirement lets it be just as portable as the console itself -- and that is incredibly novel indeed.",gaming
Jon Fingas,A whole ecosystem of animals learns from your behavior.,2017-03-28T13:28:00-04:00,"'Rain World' is a strange, ever-evolving take on survival games","In many survival-themed games , the ecosystem doesn't change much. Predators are always out to kill you, while prey just wants to mind its own business. However, you'll have to be much more thoughtful with the just-released Rain World. Videocult's long-in-the-making PS4 and Windows action adventure (its crowdfunding campaign started in 2014) has you fighting for life in a wilderness where animals learn from their interactions with you. Seemingly docile critters may start treating you as a threat if you play too aggressively, while hostile beasts might back off if you figure out what they need. Some enemies have their own predators to worry about, so you're not the only threat. You might also want to give this a look for its beautiful yet strange setting. The game has you playing as a ""slugcat"" (yes, just what it sounds like) in an overgrown, ruined landscape where you fend off neon lizards and gnaw on bats for food. And as the name suggests, there's a lot of rain -- you have to find shelter from periodic floods. Combine that with extremely fluid animations, the 16-bit retro visuals and a mysterious plot and it promises to be memorable, if more than a little unforgiving.",gaming
Nick Summers,,2017-03-28T10:00:00-04:00,'Yooka-Laylee' is at the heart of a 3D platformer revival,"A few years ago, the 3D platformer was in a bad place. Mario was still around, but the genre had little support elsewhere. Colorful games like Crash Bandicoot , Pyschonauts and Jak and Daxter had vanished in favor of grittier, more realistic adventures. There was the occasional surprise, like the papercraft-inspired Tearaway , but nothing close to the breadth of games found on the N64, PlayStation and PlayStation 2. The market had moved on, publishers thought, and it no longer made sense to fund ambitious, big-budget projects like Beyond Good and Evil. That all changed in May 2015. Playtonic Games, a small British team made up of former Rare employees, pitched a new platformer called Yooka-Laylee on Kickstarter. At their previous employer, they had worked on Banjo-Kazooie , Donkey Country and Viva Pinata , all creative and well-received titles. Yooka-Laylee , they promised, would be a 3D platformer ""rare-vival,"" bringing back the colorful words, collectibles and twin-protagonist gameplay that made the Banjo series so special. The crowdfunding campaign was a huge success, raising over £2 million (roughly $2.6 million) and hitting all of its stretch goals, which included boss battles, local co-op and four-person multiplayer, as well as an orchestral score. Clearly, backers remembered Banjo with fondness and were willing to pay for a spiritual successor. Since then, Insomniac has rebooted Ratchet & Clank , its weapon-centric space platformer, and Sony has announced a Crash Bandicoot 'N-Sane' remaster collection. Nintendo has chipped in too, unveiling Super Mario Odyssey , a successor to the likes of Super Mario 64 and Super Mario Sunshine , which is due to come out on the Switch this holiday. Yooka-Laylee , it seems, is at the center of a 3D platformer revival. ""3D platforming has its own subgenres, and they all satisfy a different itch."" ""From our point of view it's coincidental,"" Gavin Price, creative lead at Playtonic says. ""I would love to say we all got together and had a secret meeting, and said, 'Let's do this!' One big collaboration."" He continues, ""But what's brilliant is that 3D platforming has its own subgenres, and they all satisfy a different itch. You have the action-platforming of Ratchet, the gymnastical approach of Mario and the open-world collecting of us. I feel confident that you could buy all of these games and not feel like you're playing the same game twice. They have this natural inventiveness and creativity that is purely unique to those titles and characters."" Playing Yooka-Laylee is an odd experience. It's at once familiar and alienating, like you've traveled to your childhood town only to find the houses and streets rebuilt. You're quickly introduced to Yooka, a green chameleon, and Laylee, a purple bat, two troublesome heroes who have stumbled upon a magical book. It's soon ripped from their grasp, however, with the pages scattered across distant lands. Laylee sits on Yooka's head and you control them as one, rolling along the ground in a ball or lapping up enemies with Yooka's tongue. For fans of Banjo-Kazooie , the premise is nothing new. The worlds you're exploring, however, are more beautiful and interesting than anything Rare produced on the N64. As soon as the first cutscene ends, I found myself rushing toward a pirate ship and using Laylee's wings to glide where I shouldn't. Open-world collectathons have always inspired exploration, and the same holds true in Yooka-Laylee. I had forgotten about my objective completely -- to investigate a nearby factory that's hoovering up books -- and started testing whether I could open treasure chests yet. The mechanics are familiar, and I quickly found my rhythm bouncing up walls and double jumping over large gaps. I soon met Trowzer, a snake who has stretched his long body to fit inside a pair of cargo shorts. To an adult, the joke is obvious, and I couldn't help but giggle as he explained the various upgrade systems. The pun-tastic humor is a trademark of Rare games, and I'm happy to see it preserved in Playtonic's work. Notably, there's no real voice acting in Yooka-Laylee. Instead, the game provides an endless supply of made-up gibberish, performed in slightly different accents to reflect the characters and their eccentric personalities. All the dialogue is explained through subtitles, however, so it's easy to keep up with the far-fetched story. Banjo-Kazooie was the same way, and Price insists the choice was an artistic one for Yooka-Laylee rather than a way to keep development costs down. ""I'm a big fan of content that doesn't hand-hold the player and leaves creative gaps for you to inject some of your own thinking into what's going on and engage with the game on a deeper level,"" he says. ""You want to decide for yourself exactly what Yooka is like. We provide some bits and bobs of information through the way he talks, and what he says, to inform you that this is the kind of character he is. But if we were to give him a voice, we would also be closing that door for the player."" The platformer is also quick to poke fun at modern game design. Upon entering the factory, Laylee comments that Yooka ""gave himself a short tutorial on the way in."" Trowzer responds that while he'd like to help the pair, he has ""an important call coming up with the World 1 boss."" These references are littered throughout the game and emphasize the simple joy of 3D platformers. Sometimes you want a deep, BAFTA-nominated storyline, like the ones found in Firewatch , Inside and Oxenfree , but other times you just want something goofy that puts a smile on your face. That purity could be why the 3D platformer has found an audience again. ""It's nice to embrace the fact you're a video game and play to the strengths of acknowledging you're a video game,"" Price explains. The team's intent is to create comedy that works on different levels, similar to The Simpsons , Wallace and Gromit and the Disney-Pixar films. As a child, it's all innocent slapstick fun, but as an adult you can appreciate the subtle nods and winks. In the opening world, for instance, you can find tins of multicolored paint around your home. ""It's something we're a big believer in."" Price says. ""I'm sure kids won't even think about it, and say, 'Well, multicolored paint is a thing in this world, that's fine,' and not see it as a joke."" New 3D platformers offer more than upgraded visuals. While it's true that Yooka's environments are luscious, the underlying gameplay is far from a simple retread. Each world is now expandable, for example. Once you've collected enough 'Pagies,' you can unlock a new world or choose to improve an existing one. Either option will grant you new challenges, which can then be completed to repeat the process. It's a binary choice but one that gives you greater control over how the adventure unfolds. Yooka-Laylee also features a perk system. These unlocks affect your attributes in the game, simplifying challenges and catering to different play styles. In an early world called Tribalstack Tropics, I was struggling with a race that required me to roll around like a ball. Curling up consumes energy, and my stamina bar would always deplete before the finish line. I solved the problem by talking to Vendi, an enormous vending machine, who can lower the amount of energy required to perform the move. Playtonic says this perk system, and many other new features, were inspired by other video games outside the 3D platformer genre. ""There was a lot to maintain and keep in terms of what worked in the past,"" Price says,"" but we wanted to update it with new ways of engaging modern gamers' tastes as well. I think that gives the game a unique, refreshed appeal that can satisfy the old people like myself who played this stuff years ago while hopefully attracting new audiences."" Playing Yooka-Laylee , it's hard to believe the game is an indie project. Playtonic launched its Kickstarter with a six-man team, and during its development averaged 15 full-time employees. Now, two years later, the studio sits at 23. That's not a small team, especially by indie standards, but it's a fraction of the manpower that would normally be required to build a platformer of this size. As I tick off more challenges, I'm looking for the cracks, the places where the studio has decided to cut corners. Aside from the camera, which occasionally frustrates, it's hard to find any faults. ""The middleware tools have been a big help,"" Price says. ""But being a smaller team, creatively led, you don't have to worry about disrupting other cogs in the machine. You can be a lot more reactive, nimble and productive. During the day there are no meetings, and we're in an area that's similar to the size of this room [he looks around and gestures -- we're in a small bar] so if you need to shout and ask someone for something, you can just stand on your chair and say, 'Hey, come and do this!'"" Price comes across mellow and carefree, but deep down he's nervous. Yooka-Laylee is an important game for multiple reasons. For one, it's a Kickstarter game. The crowdfunding platform is divisive: For every success like Shovel Knight , there's a dramatic failure such as Yogventures or Mighty No. 9. Yooka-Laylee will inevitably fall into one of those camps, twisting people's perception of the platform accordingly. For another, it's the first game that Playtonic has released. If it's successful, the company will have the creative freedom to tackle new types of games. ""Back in the day, we were never defined by our games in one genre only. We tried our hand at all sorts."" ""Back in the day, we were never defined by our games in one genre only,"" Price explains. ""We tried our hand at all sorts. As a business proposition, that's actually really difficult to do. For a large company to say, 'Well, we're not going to be the racing game studio,' or 'We're not going to be this genre only.' That's the challenge we've now given ourselves, because the Kickstarter funding went so well. It's become a bigger opportunity than even we realized."" Playtonic has made a conscious effort to design supporting characters who could appear in their own games. Like the Mushroom Kingdom, which allows Yoshi, Wario and Princess Peach to star in their own spinoff titles, Yooka-Laylee is the starting canvas for weird and wonderful heroes (or, potentially, antiheroes) to emerge. Playtonic's goal is to become a two-game studio, developing projects in tandem. That's important, Price says, because he and his friends are older than the average indie game developer. ""None of us are getting any younger,"" he says. ""We're becoming indie developers at the age of, well, double the age most indie developers are. I remember looking at a list of game ideas we had for various characters and saying, 'Hang on, if we did all of these, I'm going to be 70!'"" Playtonic is working with Team17, best known for the Worms series, to publish Yooka-Laylee. Success will prove to creators and publishers alike that the 3D platformer can thrive again through new, alternative methods of funding. It could help avoid the problems of the early 2000s, when many middle-tier developers struggled and were ultimately forced to shut down. ""None of us are getting any younger."" ""I don't want to see other creators make fantastic games which ultimately kill them and mean they can't carry on,"" Price says. ""It's been really frustrating for me, to see games that I've really enjoyed and thought, 'Oh, they didn't get the love they deserved.' That can happen to big people as well, like Ubisoft and Beyond Good and Evil. I thought it was one of the best Zelda games I've ever played. To see it not perform as I thought it deserved was gutting. But there's certainly a lot of support out there now, and ways of making content like this viable."" The 3D platformer's future isn't certain. It's possible that the renewed interest will quickly fade, leaving Nintendo as the sole flag bearer once more. Yooka-Laylee 's Kickstarter, however, suggests that a small but viable market exists for the genre. These games have the potential to attract two different types of audiences, after all: new, younger players who never grew up with Croc , Gex or Spyro the Dragon in their home, as well as older video game enthusiasts who remember them with (mostly) fondness. In some ways, it feels like the video game equivalent of the Western. Movie depictions of the Wild West were popular in the 1950s and '60s but then quickly fell out of favor. In recent years, however, they've made a comeback, with Slow West and The Revenant succeeding at the box office. To feel new again, 3D platformers needed a similar amount of time away from our screens. It's why recently there's been a surge of 2D revivals: The point-and-click adventure game has been reborn with Broken Age and countless Telltale episodic series , and 'Metroidvania' games, inspired by Metroid and Castlevania , have been revived through titles like Axiom Verge. For the 3D platformer, it was simply a matter of time. ""Because it hasn't been served so much for so long, maybe that passion has naturally pent up and pent up,"" Price muses. ""And now it's just burst out.""",gaming

That's because the company announced today that it's releasing a new iteration of its flagship laptop, the Blade Pro. It now features a seventh-gen quad-core Intel i7 CPU and faster RAM than what was offered on last year's model. Additionally, the new model has earned THX certification for both video and audio. THX's video certification process was used to calibrate and test the laptop's resolution, color accuracy and playback performance. The sound certification measured voltage output, frequency response, distortion, signal-to-noise ratio and crosstalk for the headphone output. The Blade Pro's video capability is already top notch thanks to its NVIDIA GTX 1080 video card and 4K screen but its speakers are, well, laptop speakers, and there's always room for improvement when it comes to laptop audio. The THX certification essentially guarantees that the new model will sound (and look) as good as it possibly can. Combined with the laptop's top-of-the-line hardware, this certification cements the Blade Pro's position as both a VR/gaming and design/production rig. Other than the upgraded CPU and RAM, not much else has changed since since last year's model. The Blade Pro still weighs 7.7 pounds and measures less than an inch thick. It still features Razer's ""Chroma"" backlighting and has the same short-throw mechanical keys and 17.3-inch display. And, as with last year's model, the updated Pro comes with 32GB of RAM, supports up to 2TB of external RAID 0 storage and offers both USB 3.0 and Thunderbolt 3 ports. The new Blade Pro goes on sale in the US and Europe in April and rolling out worldwide later in the month, starting at $4,000 (£3,800/€4,500).",gaming

Welcome to Tuesday, and we're letting an AI influence our tweets, see cell division that looks like the intro to an X-Men movie, and hear about Andy Rubin's new smartphone. In case you didn't know, he was the guy behind Android. Not too bad for a Tuesday, unofficially the most average day of the week. Plug in Elon Musk's latest project is Neuralink So what's next for a billionaire after launching rockets and mass producing electric cars? If you're Elon Musk, the answer apparently is plugging computers into human brains. The Wall Street Journal reports his new venture, Neuralink, is working on ""neural lace"" technology that could allow us to upload and download our thoughts. We have our speculation about what that could mean for humanity (""I know kung-fu""), but Musk tweeted that a long post about Neuralink is coming to the Wait But Why blog in about a week. Look carefully This is (probably) not CGI Filmmaker Francis Chee posted a 23-second time-lapse video showing the cell division of a frog egg in stunning detail. According to Chee, he pulled it off with a custom-designed microscope, LEDs and optics, all set on an anti-vibration to capture the process that actually took about 33 hours. Don't throw out your hard-drive yet Intel's ultra-fast 3D storage is ready for your home PC The good news is that Intel's speedy (at least 900MB/s in peak sequential reads) Optane storage will be available for home PCs and not just servers. The bad news? With a price tag of $77 for just 32GB, it's intended for caching, allowing users to get SSD speed without needing to buy a more expensive drive that will hold all of their data. But don't worry -- if the price is no object and compromises are impossible, you can expect larger Optane SSDs to arrive later this year. Tease This is one corner of Andy Rubin's next smartphone Andy Rubin already gave you Android and the Sidekick, and now he's back with another new mobile device. His tweet shows the design features a minimal amount of bezel, but most of the details are still a mystery. The flagship smartphone from his new company Essential Products Inc. is expected to drop in the middle of this year. How can something this black be green?

Andrew Tarantola,,2017-03-27T11:00:00-04:00,'Wilson's Heart': Inside Oculus' new psychological thriller,"You come to as thunder crashes overhead. Streaks of lightning illuminate the room through gaping holes in the building's blown-out facade as you begin to take in your surroundings. But before you move on to the more pressing matters of why you're waking up in a mental hospital and why the building looks as though it survived an artillery bombardment, you'll first have to figure out how to remove the wrist restraints tethering you to this wall. The worst part is, this may well be the sanest part of your night. This is Wilson's Heart , a new psychological horror/thriller VR experience from Oculus. You play as Robert Wilson (voiced by Peter Weller, the guy from the original RoboCop ), a patient at the strange facility, who must solve the place's secrets and escape -- or die trying. I was afforded a 30-minute playthrough of the game during a recent demo and came away impressed, even though puzzle-based games are generally not what I go for. The game has a very film noir feel to it, as evidenced by the grayscale world and 1940s accoutrements, with a tinge of hallucinogenic uncertainty. It's as if the guy from Jacob's Ladder was admitted to the asylum in Shutter Island and that facility was then relocated to the land of Myst. The game is narrative and revolves largely around puzzle solving and exploration, though there are numerous combat sequences sprinkled throughout. During my demo, the investigatory sections were pretty run-of-the-mill: I simply teleported to each available destination within each room, rummaged through whatever items were present at each station (mostly just picked up keys and useful items), then teleported on to the next. It wasn't so much a matter of being clever as being observant and thorough. The combat was a bit more invigorating. While it's no Resident Evil VII , there were still plenty of skin-crawling creepy sequences, jump scares and psychological freak-outs. At the start of the game, you have yet to awaken your mysterious powers, so you're fighting mostly with found objects. At one point I was battling a bathtub octopus (don't ask) and had to stab its tentacles off of my wrists with a virtual chisel before picking up a nearby electroshock therapy box and hurling it into the bathwater. Later on, your fighting capability increases to involve throwing a strange mechanical ball that has somehow replaced your heart at foes and using the motion controllers to direct its flight path. During my demo, I used the ""heart"" to explode the heads and torsos of oncoming zombies as wave after wave of them rushed my position. Navigating through this world is very reminiscent of Myst , wherein you point and click your way through the virtual world. Robert Wilson doesn't walk; he teleports. You look where you want to go (valid destinations appear as ghostly, glowing silhouettes) and click a button on the controller. Unfortunately, this means that a vast majority of the gameplay is accomplished while standing still -- you pick up and examine objects, manipulate doors and windows, smash locks and fight an array of monsters, all without moving around. While that navigation mechanic worked well enough in Myst , it's a bit weird when wearing a VR headset. Since I have to look where I want to go and can't turn my character around using the controllers, I found myself constantly looking over my shoulder to find the next travel point, then unwinding my neck as soon as I teleport to focus on the scene in front of me. I also found the controller setup to be a bit awkward at first. Squeezing the upper and lower triggers on the Rift controllers opens and closes your in-game index finger and middle, ring and pinkie fingers, respectively. So in order to grasp an in-game object, I had to make a pinching motion in the real world, and that tactile dissonance was enough to repeatedly pull me out of my suspension of disbelief. An Oculus rep I spoke to estimates that the entire game should take around 8 hours to complete if you can figure out all of the building's mysteries quickly enough. That makes it a great option if you're looking for a game you can beat in a weekend. But I worry that there won't be much replay incentive. Since it's a narrative game, there aren't side missions to complete or GTA-style challenges to beat, so once you've beaten the main story arc, that's it. Wilson's Heart is expected to retail for $40 through the Oculus Store when it is released on April 23rd.",gaming

The studio has unveiled StarCraft: Remastered, an overhaul that drags the 1998 real-time strategy game into the modern era. It's getting the obligatory fresh coat of paint, including higher-resolution graphics and improved audio. The team is also using this as an excuse to 'fix' the game by adding content and features you take for granted. Multiplayer fans will see features that have been a staple of newer Blizzard titles, including ""advanced"" matchmaking, ladder play and social features.

The retailer has announced that it's shutting down 2 to 3 percent of 7,500 shops across the globe after sales and earning plummeted last year. According to The Wall Street Journal , the company was affected by the shift to digital downloads.

The company is trying to change all this with a brand new ""experiential"" showroom that launched this week in San Francisco. It's called Concept 190, and it's equipped with four sensor-laden bathrooms where visitors are invited to pee, poo and have a toilet experience unlike anything they've had before.

Jon Fingas,He also sees links between arcade games and the mobile world.,2017-03-26T19:57:00-04:00,'NBA Jam' creator talks about Midway's little-known history,"If you hung around arcades in the 1990s, you were likely extremely familiar with Midway sports games like NBA Jam and NFL Blitz. Apparently, though, even these classics have a few secrets left. Former Midway design lead Mark Turmell has participated in a Reddit AMA where he revealed a handful of surprises about Midway games. For instance, he confirmed that pre-release versions of NBA Jam did have Michael Jordan -- the developers had to yank him out just weeks before launch due to his Nike deal. In fact, there were custom editions given to Jordan, Ken Griffey and Gary Payton that put each of them in the game. Other insights? The original NFL Blitz was initially poised to be more violent (you could kick players while they were down) until some animations were cut to get the league's approval. Also, while the 2012 Blitz reboot was ultimately disappointing to Turmell, he notes that the team had ""toyed"" with making it a free-to-play multiplayer game that might have made it better. Turmell also points out that, in some ways, the game industry hasn't changed as much as you think. To him, arcade games and mobile games (his current focus) ""perfectly match"" each other. They're easy to get into, are often difficult to master, and revolve around short bursts of action in return for a little cash. The biggest change is simply the resources you need to make a hit. While small game teams can still shine, you usually need hundreds of people to crank out a blockbuster.",gaming
Jon Fingas,"The revamp brings 4K graphics, reworked audio and even story improvements.",2017-03-26T13:56:00-04:00,'StarCraft: Remastered' upgrades a real-time strategy classic,"Blizzard is legendary for keeping old games alive , but it's going the extra mile this time around. The studio has unveiled StarCraft: Remastered , an overhaul that drags the 1998 real-time strategy game (including the Brood War expansion) into the modern era. It's getting the obligatory fresh coat of paint, including higher-resolution graphics (with support for 4K resolution), improved audio and support for Blizzard's current game launcher and multiplayer network. However, the team is also using this as an excuse to 'fix' the game by adding content and features you take for granted. There will be reasons to play even if you've played the classic title to death. In the single-player campaign, you'll see new artwork to help improve the storytelling. Multiplayer fans will see features that have been a staple of newer Blizzard titles, including ""advanced"" matchmaking, ladder play and social features. You'll also have cloud saves for everything from your solo progress to custom maps and key bindings. About the only thing that won't change is the core gameplay. The revamp will be available sometime in the summer for both Mac and Windows users, with a price to be set later. You won't have to wait that long to walk down memory lane, however. Blizzard is patching the original Brood War -- yes, a 19-year-old title -- to improve Windows compatibility and add features like rebinding and an eSports-friendly observer mode. And when the update is ready, StarCraft Anthology (including both the original game and Brood War ) will be free. Yes, this is another instance of a developer hopping on the remaster bandwagon. It's a relatively easy way to make money from nostalgic gamers, and Blizzard has plenty of those given its track record. With that said, Blizzard has a better reason than most to revisit history. There was a 12-year gap between the original game and its sequel -- many of those who cut their teeth on StarCraft II were too young to have played the first game when new, and the technological gap is so vast that the first game was quickly becoming unplayable. This gives younger players a chance to see what they missed, and lets veterans return even on a cutting-edge PC.",gaming
Jon Fingas,Running a non-stop Twitch channel could be expensive.,2017-03-25T23:02:00-04:00,Germany wants to regulate a 24-hour livestream as a broadcaster,"You might want to think twice about running a non-stop livestream just because you can -- at least in Germany, regulators will want to have a word with you. They've told the 24-hour let's play channel PietSmietTV that it has to apply for a broadcasting license by April 30th if it wants to keep running. While it's operating through Twitch and YouTube instead of TV or radio, it technically meets all the legal definitions of a broadcaster: it's a ""linear information and communication service"" aimed at the public, with an editorial focus and not meant for personal purposes. Channel founder Peter Smits is respecting the decision, so there isn't going to be a fight. And importantly, this isn't a one-off case. Officials see this as setting an example that could apply to other livestreams that fit the terms. While they'd like to see legislation that specifically regulates internet streams, they've decided to apply existing law in the meantime. The problem, of course, is that this isn't a modest request for most people. On top of the usual paperwork, streamers are looking at a cost of between €1,000 to €10,000 ($1,080 to $10,800). That's relatively trivial for a TV station, but it's a lot more intimidating for someone streaming video from home. And there's also the question of what else falls under this regulation. Would shorter streams and on-demand video also qualify? There's a chance that German internet users will have to think very carefully before they go live. [Thanks, Kristy]",gaming

In other tweets, Musk mentioned that a dual-motor AWD performance version of the Model 3 would probably follow next year, along with an RHD version for markets like the UK.

Mariella Moon,The retailer will expand its non-gaming businesses following a major sales decline.,2017-03-25T06:34:00-04:00,Digital downloads killed 150 GameStop stores,"It's game over for at least 150 GameStop stores. The retailer has announced that it's shutting down 2 to 3 percent of 7,500 shops across the globe after sales and earning plummeted last year. According to The Wall Street Journal , the company was affected by the shift to digital downloads. More and more people now prefer installing their games straight from their console's online store instead of buying physical copies, that GameStop's sales dropped 14 percent in 2016. It did especially bad this past holiday season when its sales dipped 19 percent. As a result, its fourth-quarter profits fell 16 percent and its shares went down by about 12 percent, as well. The video game retailer didn't say which stores are shutting down. Its US stores were affected by the sales slum the most, though, so expect quite a few outlets Stateside to bid farewell.v From now on, the video game retailer will start expanding its non-gaming businesses. It plans to open 35 more collectible stores this year, bringing the total number of locations to 121. Unlike its core business, the company's collectibles division has been doing very well -- its sales were up by 59.5 percent in 2016, and GameStop expects sales to go up by another 30 to 40 percent this year. It's not giving up on its gaming business, though: it's hoping the latest generation of consoles, particularly the Nintendo Switch, can help it regain its former glory. Chief Executive J. Paul Raines told the WSJ that ""The Switch has provided a dramatic lift in traffic in stores and has real potential to be Wii-like in its ability to expand the gaming category from core to broad audiences."" Nintendo's hybrid console is its fastest-selling ever, and it plans to double production to 16 million units for 2017, which sounds like good news for GameStop. For now (and probably until it's doing much better), the retailer will no longer publish quarterly financial projections to ""reduce investor distraction.""",gaming

Devindra Hardawar,"""We have a few moments of greatness.""",2017-03-24T13:00:00-04:00,Logitech's CEO says you can innovate and be humble,"Logitech is a rare technology company. It's been around for 35 years, all the while finding different ways to thrive as an independent accessory maker. But despite being a well-known brand, it's never been considered ""hip"" like Apple or Beats. Instead of betting big on showy new products, Logitech has always focused on finding successful niches in which it can build a small-but-loyal following. And according to the company's CEO, Bracken Darrell, he wouldn't have it any other way. At SXSW last week, I sat down with Darrell to chat about the road ahead for Logitech. Where is Logitech now and where is it going? When I look around, I see that everything will be reinvented. It may take 20 years, but there won't be a single thing in this room that isn't connected. In that world, it's so cool because the really large companies can't do everything, nor would they want to. It leaves room for people like us to go into small ponds where we can be a big fish. We're never going to try to compete with the big guys in anything that's meaningful to them. But we can go into a lot of little places. There are so many opportunities. We have a lot of technologies, great acoustics, far-field mics, video sensors. And we're building out our software capabilities, so we can offer something where we should. Are we going to see more products like the Circle camera relying on connected software? I always say, we want to be capable of doing it, but we don't need to do it. We'll do it where it makes sense, where the business model requires it. But, in general, we're perfectly happy letting cloud companies fulfill their mission and enable them through hardware. We're also willing to jump up into the cloud and create our own service when we need to. I think the key is flexibility. Logitech has always been known as more of an accessory company. Since tech is expanding now, does that mean there are now more areas for you to conquer? The analogy that I always use is, if you watched us during our heyday, during the peak of the growth curve that happened between 1997 and 1998 to 2008, the platform was growing, and that was the PC. We had mice and keyboards, and we were gaining share during that period. We had different ways to grow: The platform grew, we were adding new categories like speakers and cameras, but the total mix was really exciting. What's happening now is that the PC has kind of flatlined, so now we peripheralize cloud-based services. Let's take streaming music: If you took the growth of Bluetooth speakers and looked at where streaming music was going, they overlapped completely. So we offer a peripheral [the UE wireless speakers ] that lets you bring that music anywhere you want and play it with people. We're doing the same thing in gaming. In video conferencing, we're not really creating point to point video conferencing, but we're creating peripherals that lets anyone join the party in the cloud. That's the future for us. It's about making good choices and being ready for mistakes and failures. Logitech's also known for its hardware, is your focus on that changing moving forward? I would say we have changed. We now have someone in charge of software engineering in every business, more than firmware. The Circle camera is probably the best example, where we're actually doing machine learning. Do I think we need to be a machine-learning-expert company? I don't. I think we ought to be able to do it where we need to do it and have very strong capabilities when we're doing it. Usually, we're going to be offering an experience at the very end, and that's our game. I've noticed a couple categories, like Bluetooth speakers, where Logitech has taken a lead. How does Logitech approach new markets? We're really not dominant in anything. We're kind of humble about everything. We have a few moments of greatness. When we go into a category, we try to design it from a consumer experience out. So, for example, with Bluetooth speakers, the reason that product did well was because we really started with thinking, ""How are people going to use this?"" We saw that people would cut the cord with a Bluetooth speaker and that was it, it would just sit in the middle of a table. That was great because it was wireless, but I don't think it was the logical extreme of what you had. What happens? When you go out and listen to music in the wild, you tend to go to places with tables, and it's usually not just two people. It sits in the middle of the table and everyone wants to feel like part of the party, so you're worried about where to turn it. So we made it circular, which was hard in the beginning, but now other people [like Amazon with the Echo ] have followed us. And then we said, we know people are going to take it into places where it's going to get wet, so we made it waterproof. We made it super-sturdy so you can practically drop it out of a building without [causing] damage. And a lot of other people's speakers were really fragile. The other thing we did was say, when you're buying a portable speaker today it's different from what it was in your home because you're using it with your phone. So it should have an app where we can constantly upgrade it. So we made it so that you can connect two speakers in stereo, now you can connect around 200 more and play as many as you want. And we just kept updating it. What are you looking at in terms of upcoming categories? VR seems like it'll need a lot of accessories. We're not really sure what we're going to do next. But VR and AR, we're doing a lot of work in there. I don't know when we're going to launch something, it may not be anytime soon. We certainly are interested in it, though, and we're doing a lot of experimentation to try and understand how VR is likely to unfold and what accessories will be around it, who the players are. It's a really exciting place. With the way Microsoft has opened up Windows Holographic , lots of PC companies will be making VR headsets. I could see a Windows Holographic Logitech headset at some point. We're open to everything. And we like anything that really feels like it can enhance the experience right at the end. We'll do other things, but that really feels like home. It's way too early for me to talk much about it. It seems more companies want to build up their hardware expertise these days. Is Logitech fiercely independent at this point, or would you ever consider joining another company? We have no desire to be bought, nor would I say it would never happen. At the end of the day, I don't really even think in those terms. We're just trying to create amazing experiences, and if we do that, we've accomplished our goals. And we want to do it consistently over time and have an engine that builds the capability to do that. I don't know what that means from an ownership standpoint. We've always been happy being independent. Which of your products are you most excited about right now? That's like asking me which of my children are my favorite! I'm really excited about all of them. I love gaming; it's so fun and dynamic, and it feels a little like the beginning of the NBA or NFL.... Have you seen Spotlight? [Logitech's new presentation remote.] I just love that product. The cool thing is that it's one of the ways we've really thought through it. It's really an attempt to make someone more relaxed and confident when they speak. It's about making you feel like, ""Wow, I'm going to kill this presentation."" You've made acquisitions, like Ultimate Ears. How do you decide when to buy another company versus building something yourselves? You know, it's really simple. We're always working on sprints. We're working on three to 12 things at a time, all the time, that are not things we're in. I view acquisitions completely as a way to accelerate something we're doing or differentiate within it. You won't see us just buy something. Anything we've bought, we're already working on. We just bought Jaybird [makers of wireless headphones]. We love that space. What attracts Logitech to the audio market? Most consumers generally don't pay that much attention to their audio these days. Now, I won't be humble for a minute: We have such great acoustic capabilities. We have a lot of people at the company who are bleeding music. They're so into it. And then we also have the technology capabilities. It'd be a shame if we couldn't take advantage of that. It's obviously a hot space now; the key is finding our little niche in it. We don't want to go taking on everyone big. We do headphones for gaming -- that's a great business -- and we do them for sports. It kind of inspires you to get out there, they're helmet-ready. Jaybird was originally built in the mountains -- it was for people who were really into outdoor sports. And then we're doing the custom-earphone business. It's funny you're so focused on niches -- Beats came out of nowhere to get people into expensive headphones. Why isn't Logitech playing in that space? I think Jimmy Iovine and all of the people who worked at Beats did an amazing job building that brand. They did such a marketing job that you can't help but be in awe of it. We admire that. We're building our marketing capability. We're not bad, but we could be better. If you place us in that timeframe [when Beats was getting started], you could see we were making different choices. I think what Jimmy Iovine had that we didn't was access to celebrities, at an incredible cost. He was sitting in a chair, and he is so respected, he's such a leader, and he was a magnet for that talent. I met him once and told him, ""Wow, what you and Dr. Dre did has never been done before.""

Sean Buckley,Launching games with Razer Cortex can earn players zVault points.,2017-03-24T01:00:00-04:00,Razer's 'paid to play' program bribes gamers to use its Cortex software,"Lingering in the mind of every gamer is a silly, whimsical idea that very few manage to make a reality. ""Gee,"" we think to ourselves. ""It sure would be neat if I could get someone to pay me to play video games."" Most of us know it's a futile dream, but it's a desire Razer is banking on. Today the company announced its ""paid to play"" initiative, a program that's almost exactly what it sounds like. Yes, Razer is going to reward gamers for play their favorite games, but those players won't be earning cash -- they'll be earning ZSilver points from the company's new digital currency platform. Players can earn digital currency by launching games with Razer Cortex, a desktop software suite designed to tweak system performance, manage game libraries and stream gameplay to sites like Twitch and YouTube. The paid for play campaign will reward players with three zSilver for each minute played. These zVault points aren't legal tender, but they're not useless either. zSilver points can be redeemed for discounts or products from the Razer store, and the company says it hopes to add things like movie tickets or coffee vouchers (presumably for a popular cafe chain) in the future. Still, earning rewards will be a long-haul effort: players are capped at 900 points a day and zSilver rewards range from 4,500 points for a product discount to 220,000 for a mechanical keyboard. The paid to play system isn't compatible with all games either, though it clearly has a market. Competitive multiplayer titles like Overwatch, Counter-Strike: Global Offensive and League of Legends are among the most popular games confirmed to be part of the program. These are the kind of games dedicated fans return to day after day. That makes sense, too -- to get the full 900 daily zSilver points, one would need to play at least five hours.

This isn't the beginning of a terrible joke: Instead, it's the premise of a conversation between Engadget associate editor Timothy J. Seppala and senior reporter Jessica Conditt , both of whom have been playing the latest Mass Effect game, Andromeda , over the past few weeks. Tim has devoured and adored the Mass Effect series for almost a decade while Jessica has never touched the games before. How does Andromeda compare to previous Mass Effect games?

Spoilers for the entire Mass Effect series reside below; you've been warned. Timothy J. Seppala, Mass Effect fan Jess, it pains me to say this, but I don't want to play more of Mass Effect: Andromeda. I've spent hundreds of hours in that universe, playing through the previous trilogy a handful of times as the altruistic Timothy J. Shepard and as his evil counterpart Toni Shepard. Together, they helped form some of my fondest recent gaming memories. The games were nowhere near perfect, but their rough charm made them all the more endearing. It was easy to overlook how awful the UI and cover system were in the first game when I had a team of ridiculously well-developed alien compatriots along for the ride. More than in any series prior, Mass Effect's characters felt like friends. The bond I formed with those characters helped carry me through the sequels and their increased focus on being action RPGs versus the hard-core role-playing games developer BioWare was known for. I'll never forget my reflexive scream when Legion, a former enemy robot, and Tali, a mysterious helmeted scientist, sacrificed themselves in Mass Effect 3 within moments of each other. I thought I'd saved them both from certain doom before that cliffside conversation. Watching helplessly as Legion gave his life and Tali took her own was a 1-2 punch to the gut after all the time we'd spent together. It wasn't easy, but I managed to keep my expectations tempered going into Andromeda. And somehow, I'm still disappointed. You've never played a Mass Effect prior, so I'm curious how you're feeling about the game. After all, it's a new story line that's set in an entirely new galaxy, so it should be a good starting point for people, right? Jessica Conditt, Mass Effect noob I was worried I'd have to argue that one of your favorite series is actually generic and janky garbage, so I'm glad you came out and said it first. Timothy J. Seppala I can love something and still admit it has flaws! It's called being a rational adult. Jessica Conditt You're a saint -- and I might have been a little harsh. I'm only a few hours into Andromeda, and I realize this game is not representative of the entire Mass Effect franchise. However, as a new player, it's all I have to go on. And so far, I simply don't understand the hype. Mass Effect: Andromeda is broken. When I think about my time with the game, the first thing that springs to mind is how busted some of its mechanics, animations and narrative arcs are. The camera angles during dialogue scenes look as if they were directed by a film school sophomore attempting to ""recapture Kubrick's melodrama"" and the characters' facial animations are distractingly stilted, as the internet has already noticed. It's not all terrible though. I truly enjoy Andromeda 's combat; these scenes remind me of Halo and Gears of War but with a fun super-powered twist. I also love how my character looks: I'm playing as Chenault Ryder, a female model with neck and face tattoos and cotton-candy pink hair. It's wonderful to see her flying around deep space, kicking ass. What I'm most curious about is the story. So far, Andromeda 's narrative has felt uninspired, and I'd always had the sense that Mass Effect was a rich and unique sci-fi landscape. So, Tim, tell me: How does Andromeda 's story compare with previous Mass Effect games? Timothy J. Seppala Well, so far, the narrative is on a much smaller scale -- the polar opposite of the previous games. The Shepard trilogy was a gigantic space opera about saving the galaxy from a race of ancient machines that emerge from their hiding spots and wipe the galaxy of all organic life every 50,000 years. You know, the usual. On top of that, Shepard him/herself had to represent humanity to the rest of the galaxy and prove that we aren't just a bunch of bullies. Or not. I mean, if your evil-speech skill was high enough, you could coerce the end boss to commit suicide. In contrast, Andromeda feels a little more personal and self-contained. As one of the twentysomething Ryder twins (above), you're out to find your dad and somehow settle an entirely new galaxy. And then a few laborious hours of generic third-person shooting and an overlong vehicle segment later, Andromeda reveals its hand and shows what the game is really about. Rather than appeasing the Space United Nations, you're dealing with interpersonal conflicts. There are larger implications from your actions though. Will your first outpost on an alien world be a research facility focusing on science? Or is setting up a military to help guard against the Kett, your cannon fodder for the game, more your style? Jessica Conditt Kill everyone, obviously. Timothy J. Seppala Jerk. See, I picked science because (at least in video games) I'm idealistic and want to show the galaxy that we don't always need to pull a gun to get a point across. That choice is already bearing fruit. Those narrative themes work for me; establishing an identity for the human race and settling worlds is kind of my jam. But Andromeda has other story ideas in mind too. Like the Kett leader who's a religious fanatic and effectively turns the game's new alien race into zombies. I could not care less for this. I'm guessing at some point I'll have to put my terraforming efforts and search for Dad aside and kill him. My hangup is that it's a generic sci-fi trope, and one that's been done many times over in other games. 'Sup, Halo? More damning than that, Andromeda is doing a poor job of getting new players up to speed with the galaxy's goings-on. The story takes place 600 years adjacent to the original trilogy, but (spoiler) there are some returning names. Words like ""genophage"" and ""geth"" are peppered casually throughout conversations with no real explanation for what they are. Or when they are detailed it feels shoehorned in, like half-assed fan service. To your larger point, what I've always loved about the series is its absurdly detailed world building. At the risk of oversimplifying, the Salarians and Krogan hate each other because the former used genetic engineering to reduce the latter's population. Krogan are a race that thrives on war and conflict, so in the interest of the greater good a vast majority of the race was sterilized with the genophage. In Mass Effect 3 I reversed that, and Mordin Solus, my crew's Salarian scientist, sacrificed his life doing so. The Krogan/Salarian relationship was one of many like it, and they were all incredibly well done. Jessica Conditt That is what I'm missing from Andromeda : The sense of a living, complex universe. Timothy J. Seppala See, I thought it was just me. One of my other gripes is that in the Shepard games, story and character development we not only delivered via exposition dumps or conversations but also peppered into combat. Picking my two squadmates before going planetside was dictated as much by who I wanted to learn more about as it was by their combat abilities. They'd chatter among themselves during quiet moments, and, in a firefight, I could use space magic to lift an enemy off the ground and have one squadmate slam him back into it while another sniped from a distance. As far as I can tell, that isn't the case here. I spent the majority of my time on Havarl, the fourth planet, with two lockjawed squadmates. And aside from ordering my Krogan, Drack, to move to one position and Jaal the Angaran to another, there isn't much by way of tactics. It feels like a huge step backward both for gameplay and narrative reasons. In Andromeda I can sub in basically any squadmate and the sortie will feel the same. The combat is fine (aside from the finicky cover system), but it definitely doesn't feel like Mass Effect. Jessica Conditt ""The combat is fine"" sums up my feelings as well. I actually enjoy the shooty-shooty-bang-bang portions of Andromeda so far, though I've played more-enthralling action games already this year. Of course, I'm not comparing Andromeda to the teamwork mechanics of previous games. As for the narrative -- I love the idea of colonizing a new galaxy for the human race. That's an incredible premise for a video game, though it definitely has been done before. With such a pure sci-fi premise, Andromeda has to nail its storytelling arcs and build believable, complex characters and relationships; otherwise, the entire game becomes bland. Unfortunately, the details are precisely where the story falls apart for me. I don't care much about my crewmates yet, partially because I can hardly see their faces while I'm talking with them, and the story beats don't always align with the personality choices I make. At one point, I land on an alien planet for the first time and instruct my crew to be vigilant yet respectful. ""We're the aliens here,"" I say around bubblegum-pink lip gloss (Chenault is very on trend). A handful of minutes later, I'm pumping a horde of strange creatures full of lead and lasers, and my squadmates are telling me to shoot any other aliens that I see on sight, in a ""give 'em hell, kid"" kind of way. The transition from cautious explorer to violent conqueror is whiplash-inducing. I love the epic scope of Andromeda. I think this kind of story -- one that deals with the cosmic future of the human race -- is relevant right now, as private companies are gearing up to colonize Mars and NASA is discovering potentially habitable planets in nearby galaxies. Essentially, it feels as if Andromeda represented a brilliant opportunity to tell a powerful story about humanity's future, and BioWare took the whole thing in an expected, generic direction. It's not bad. It's just kind of boring. Portions of Andromeda are gorgeous, though these are mainly cut scenes, and I adore my own character. The combat moments are engaging and fun, though so far they represent a minority of the gameplay. Much of Andromeda deals with dialogue choices and building personal relationships among the characters, but so far I haven't formed any memorable friendships, foes or love interests. There's nothing about Andromeda that makes me want to boot it up at the end of the day; I don't ponder its story or crave its mechanics when I'm not playing. Unfortunately for BioWare, 2017 is a great year for role-playing games, with The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild and Horizon: Zero Dawn already on the market. In my mind, Andromeda just doesn't compare -- no matter how cool my character's hair is. Timothy J. Seppala ""Andromeda is about new beginnings."" That wasn't a quote from a developer or a PR rep; it came from a Krogan I happened upon in the game. While he was speaking directly about the titular galaxy, to me he was describing Mass Effect as a whole. If you want to take it even deeper, you could argue that the game's story of being prematurely forced into your dad's old role is allegorical for BioWare itself. We watched as numerous key talent left during Andromeda 's development cycle - - including longtime executive producer Casey Hudson and, prior to that, studio founders Drs. Ray Muzyka and Greg Zeschuk - - and I can't help but feel some of that is reflected in the game's narrative. That's not to mention the wildly inconsistent nuts and bolts of its gameplay. If it weren't for the promise that everything I do in this game will carry forward, I wouldn't give a second thought to putting Andromeda down for good. Really all I want to do is drop the difficulty to ""easy"" so I can enjoy the best aspect of what I've played so far: lengthy bouts of talking with my crew. I'm well past the awful beginning hours that've plagued the series since 2007. Now? I want to get to the good stuff as frequently as possible. I have some time before the sequel though, so like you I'm going back to Zelda and Horizon. What makes Andromeda so troubling is that I'm not sure if Mass Effect is still for me and if BioWare remembers what made the previous games so special.",gaming

Time flies, though, and the original game is nearly three years old, and Bungie has promised a full sequel will be coming soon. Now, thanks to an poster image apparently leaked by an Italian retailer (and posted by Italian site Lega Network), we can be pretty sure that Destiny 2 will arrive this September. Friday, September 8th in Europe, to be precise -- which means the US release date could be the prior Tuesday, September 5th. We haven't heard much about the game itself so far, although we do know that most of the progress you've made in the original Destiny won't carry over to the sequel. Kotaku believes that Bungie and Activision will officially release more details about the sequel today, and it also thinks the game will come to the PC in addition to the Xbox One and PS4 this time. We should find out more later today, but for now just feast your eyes on the above image and get ready to kiss the three years of progress you've made in the original game goodbye.

The researchers also twisted the plate the plants are growing on to see how the roots adjust to changes in gravity, which could be helpful when we need to grow food in space. Meanwhile, a teenager was able to talk his dad into allowing him and his friends to use the family's Chevy Volt as a giant controller for Mario Kart.

Google Project Zero researcher Tavis Ormandy identified a few bugs in extensions for LastPass that could allow someone to steal a target's passwords, or in some cases run code on their computer. The company quickly responded to deal with the issues, so any users should make sure they're patched up (and using two-factor authentication in addition to unique passwords, or perhaps another manager that works separately from the browser like KeePass.)

Rob LeFebvre,Blizzard finally stops treating PlayStation and Xbox owners like they don’t matter.,2017-03-22T19:39:00-04:00,"Three years later, 'Diablo III' Seasons mode heads to consoles","It might be time to rekindle your love for the loot-fest of Diablo III. A big new patch with a ton of tweaks for the hack and slash dungeon crawler will land on March 31st. The update finally brings the popular Seasons mode to Xbox One and PlayStation 4. Seasons has been available to PC players since 2014 and now console players will finally get to join in the fun. We've asked Blizzard why it took so long to bring Seasons to consoles and will update if we receive a response. For the uninitiated, Seasons lets you experience Diablo III just like a new player would with a level one character. You'll level up and upgrade your gear faster than with a higher level character, which can be fun for veteran players who have to grind a lot more to see gains. It can also be a great way to take a friend through the game for the first time, since you'll both get to play with a clean slate at the same difficulty level. You can either create a new character or ""rebirth"" a current one, reverting it to level one and classifying it as Seasonal. Seasons also includes leaderboards and mission-like tasks in the Season Journey, as well as more difficult Conquest challenges — both only available to new characters created for this game mode. Characters revert to regular status when the Season ends, but you'll get to keep all the loot you gather, some of which will apply to all your Diablo III characters. In addition, update 2.5.0 brings several rewards, cosmetic upgrades and user interface tweaks, creating a similar experience across all platforms. Though, players are still sequestered to their own platform-specific servers. The patch itself is available now, so pick up your controller and get ready to smash your way through waves of demons when Seasons goes live on March 31.",gaming

This free update rolls out to Xbox One, PlayStation 4 and PC today, bringing a new competitive tournament as well as some goofy Easter-themed items for your in-game automobile. Dropshot changes things up in a big way. The new mode has no goalposts, unlike other Rocket League arenas. Instead, each side of the field is covered with destructible hexagons. Smash the massive soccer ball with your jet-car into the ground to destroy the ground and then use the resulting hole to score. It takes two hits to fully destroy a hex space in the arena. When you do score, your opponent's hexes repair themselves while yours stay as is. In addition, you can now electrify the ball to do splash damage when it hits. All told, a fully powered ball can smash up to 19 panels. This new mode is full of even more intense strategic action for Rocket League players. The patch also brings three new cosmetic items to your car: an Easter egg antenna ball and two silly but fun roof decorations, an Easter basket and set of bunny ears.

Nick Summers,"The Wii U version has been canned, however.",2017-03-22T08:31:00-04:00,'Castlevania' successor 'Bloodstained' is coming to the Switch,"The next game by Castlevania mastermind Koji Igarashi is coming to the Nintendo Switch. Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night was pitched on Kickstarter in 2015 as a spiritual successor to the beloved gothic adventure series. With Igarashi at the helm and the promise of new, updated 'Metroidvania' gameplay -- a style that fuses side-scroller platforming with deep exploration and RPG mechanics -- the project raised more than $5.5 million from 64,867 backers. The updated platform support does come with a downside, however -- the Wii U version is being cancelled. In a backer update , the team said the launch of the Switch had made it ""difficult to receive the necessary support"" from Nintendo for the Wii U version. ""We are very sorry that it has come to this after all your support, but we hope you will understand,"" the post reads. Backers who had selected the Wii U as their preferred platform will now receive the Switch version automatically. It will be possible, however, to request a PC, PlayStation 4, Xbox One or Vita copy instead, using the team's backer survey tool. Supporters can also get a full refund, should they prefer. The Switch release is good news for Nintendo. The company needs a steady flow of games to keep owners and prospective buyers interested in the platform. Nintendo's first-party exclusives will always be the main draw, but the company could use some third-party software to fill the gaps in between. The Switch is underpowered compared to the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One, so support will likely come from smaller indie releases. Games like WarGroove , Stardew Valley and Overcooked , as well as Yooka-Laylee , which also ditched the Wii U in favor of Nintendo's new console. If you're a Castlevania fan, however, you might have to wait a while for Bloodstained. The game was delayed last September from a planned March 2017 release to the first half of 2018. ""The last thing I want to do is keep our backers waiting,"" Igarashi said at the time, ""but after receiving such incredible support, I feel responsible for delivering the best product I possibly can. Again, I offer my sincerest apologies."" For Switch owners, then, it's one to put in the diary and forget.

While that won't give players an edge (or expanded functionality) like the Elite controller's finely-tuned sensors and alt-control paddles, the Recon Tech includes the standard Wireless controller's Bluetooth capability to hook up to Windows 10 and Samsung Gear VR. Plus, the $70 Recon is still relatively affordable compared to the Elite's $150 pricetag. As is typical with the Xbox One gamepad options, you're paying a premium for style, since every other unique paint scheme (including custom jobs from the Design Lab) costs $10-$30 more than the $50 stock wireless controller.",gaming
Stefanie Fogel,Competitive players are going to have to wait a week to play her.,2017-03-21T16:38:00-04:00,'Overwatch's' four-legged tank hero is here (for casual players),"Overwatch's new badass robot centaur Orisa makes her official debut today, but players hoping to climb those Season 4 ranks with her are going to have to wait. Blizzard is disabling her from Competitive mode for one week, according to the game's official forums and Twitter account, so people can get to know her a little better first. Like Reinhardt, Orisa's an ""anchor tank,"" someone who can absorb large amounts of damage, protect teammates and rally the team behind her. Her ultimate, Supercharger, provides a 50 percent damage boost to teammates in range. Although she's not available in Competitive mode just yet, players can test out her skills in Quick Play, Arcade mode (including custom games with the competitive ruleset) and Play vs. AI. Blizzard is treating Orisa's launch differently than previously-released heroes like Ana and Sombra. Those characters, released during Season 1 and Season 3, respectively, both initially struggled to find a place on competitive teams. Ana has since become a popular support choice thanks to her Nano Boost ultimate and her healing abilities. Sombra, meanwhile, has seen a bit of pro level play, but still has to fight for a spot. Delaying Orisa's debut could give players time to develop strategies without affecting their rankings. We've contacted Blizzard to find out more about their decision to temporarily disable Orisa in Competitive Play, and we'll update this story if we hear back. Our own Jessica Conditt took Orisa for a spin earlier today. You can check her out in this video.",gaming
Derrick Rossignol,This PS4 game gives you total control over… everything.,2017-03-21T15:11:00-04:00,Play as a ladybug or a traffic cone in 'Everything',"Think of anything that exists. For example, a bear, an atom, a galaxy, a three-leaf clover, and so on. That's what you can control in the game Everything , which was just released for the Playstation 4 today. The game has goals and tasks for the player to complete like any other, but the main appeal is in its sandbox elements. Simply put, Everything gives you total control over every possible element. As creator and developer David OReilly wrote in a blog post , ""You can change every single object in the universe to horses."" Generally speaking, you have control over any object that you can see in the game. Instead of creating animations for every conceivable thing, objects move by rolling, sliding, or floating around. Cutting those corners can be forgiven, considering this $15 game was made by a three-person team. That can also be chalked up as a stylistic choice, and besides, that's not the point of the game. Everything is about being. The parameters of existence can be altered at will, but like the real world, life will happen regardless of the player's input. Every object has its own AI, and OReilly said that "" Everything can play itself automatically for weeks at a time."" It makes sense that a game as existential as this was inspired heavily by philosopher Alan Watts. The game is even narrated by recordings of the late British speaker. As artfully demonstrated in a 10-minute gameplay trailer , these voiceovers help put the game's scale in perspective. They're effective because, as OReilly wrote, Watts ""had an extraordinary talent for describing the indescribable."" No Man's Sky showed that super ambitious games with lofty goals can fall short of expectations. That said, the idea of Everything is too intriguing to ignore. Everything is currently only available on PS4, but Mac and PC users will be able to download it on Steam beginning April 21st. The game is bizarre and fascinating, and we hope delivers on its big promises.",gaming
Jessica Conditt,,2017-03-21T14:30:00-04:00,The hidden depth of mobile puzzle game 'Where Cards Fall',"We're sitting in a circle on the floor of a decadent San Francisco hotel lobby, crowds of people milling around the couches and stairways. The young men of Snowman, the studio behind Alto's Adventure , watch as Sam Rosenthal sets up a small iPad, preparing to show off his latest game, Where Cards Fall. Rosenthal is the co-founder of the Game Band, a small Los Angeles studio working with Snowman to bring its new project to iOS, Apple TV and Steam this autumn. Rosenthal flips through a slideshow of character designs, explaining the premise as he goes. Where Cards Fall is a top-down, 3D puzzle game that has players build houses of cards to navigate tricky environments. It follows a handful of teenagers over the course of 10 years, from adolescence to college and finally adulthood. The art is cartoonish yet polished, as if the designs of Oxenfree had been transformed into 3D. Where Cards Fall is primarily a mobile game, but its mechanics and story are deeper than the genre generally suggests. This is why The Game Band teamed up with Snowman, a studio with a history of tapping into the potential of the mobile market. In Where Cards Fall , the suburbs are filled with rolling hill-like platforms pockmarked with the tops of buildings that look perfect for leaping. Eventually, Rosenthal explains, the characters will leave this area for the cities and eventually the clouds, which are filled with floating houses, winged towns and towering skyscrapers. For now, though, we're sticking to the suburbs, just 45 minutes into the main game. Rosenthal loads up the demo and a blaring alarm noise emanates from the iPad. Once the jarring sounds fade away, light music fills the air, a mellow yet bouncy jazz keyboard. A high-school-age character shuffles out of bed in a cheery digital world. ""We're beginning with a section that most of us can relate to: being late for school in the morning,"" Rosenthal says. ""We like to play a bit with walk cycles and animations -- we drastically reduced the speed here to make you really feel like 'Oh, I'm groggy in the morning and not getting it together.' But yeah, the game begins inside of the house of cards. I'll take you outside in a second."" The main character stumbles around the house, pulling on a bright oversize sweater and tight jeans, short brown hair sticking up wildly. I ask what the character's name is. I don't realize it's a loaded question. ""We actually don't have a name for the main character, and there's a reason for that,"" Rosenthal says, tapping and dragging away on the screen. ""All of our characters are nameless, because we want to tell a story with no dialogue at all to try to make it feel as universal as possible. But with the main character -- this is something we haven't actually talked about too much yet -- but we specifically designed the character to be gender ambiguous so that players can figure out what they think they want the main character to be. ""There's scenes in the game that will be a little bit more gender specific, like the dance and such, and we just let you dress up however you want, take whoever you want. Whatever is in your mind is what we'll honor in the game."" ""I see that now,"" I say. Looking again, the main character is perfectly ambiguous. I mention I had just assumed it was a girl. ""To be honest, it totally just came from our playtesters,"" Rosenthal says. ""We designed the character originally as a different design, and all of our girl playtesters were saying 'she' and all of our guys were saying 'he,' and we decided to run with that design."" Rosenthal taps outside of the house, and the character opens the door. He touches the screen and the character moves toward his finger; he drags it and the character follows the path he's laid out. The keyboard music keeps bopping away, light and contented. Each platform will have its own unique control mechanic: haptic feedback and 3D touch on the iPhone, possible Touch Bar integration on the Macbook Pro and the ability to play the entire game with the Siri Remote on Apple TV. With the Apple Pencil , players are able to draw a path for their characters to walk down, winding up walkways and around corners. It's specific, direct control. The game itself is seamless, with no distinct levels, which means it supports various play styles -- quick bursts on mobile or longer play sessions at home. On-screen, Rosenthal's character is standing in the middle of a friendly, sunny day. He needs to get the character to a high-up platform, which means it's time to start building some houses. ""The houses of cards do a lot of different things in this game,"" Rosenthal says. ""Their most primary function is that they can become platforms. You create platforms by spreading out a pile, and when I let go, it turns into a house of cards."" Using his pointer finger and thumb, he picks up a pile of black-backed cards and positions it on the ground. He lets go and a house pops up with a quick shuffling sound, fully formed and ready to move into. But this isn't The Sims, and Rosenthal isn't building houses just for people to live in. ""I'll use this as a bridge now to get further ahead."" He jumps to the newly formed rooftop and onto an adjacent platform farther up the path. ""I can knock 'em down too. I'll just pinch here."" He squeezes the house with his forefinger and thumb and, with a crinkling sound, it collapses back into a black pile. ""One neat thing about them is that I can also make them different sizes,"" Rosenthal explains. ""So if I pinch a little bit smaller, I get a smaller house of cards too."" He builds a house in the middle of a large gap. ""But this isn't going to help me just yet, because it's still not tall enough. So I'll put a little chimney on it with the other cards I have, and use that to cross."" He pinches, drags and positions a small pile of cards on top of the existing house. It's just enough to allow the main character to cross the gap. With a shuffling sound, Rosenthal pinches his cards back into a pile. He pulls up a new stack of cards -- the white markings on the back of this one are slightly different from the others he's been using. It's a flat-top, more industrial-style building. ""This is a different type of structure; you can see that with the icon on it,"" Rosenthal says. There's a quick swoosh-swoosh as he minimizes and expands a handful of buildings, creating makeshift bridges and adorable houses at the same time. He crosses another gap, his character jumping seamlessly from one platform to the next. The jazzy music hums in the background, picking up more sounds as we progress, adding tingling synthetic chimes and percussion. He pauses the main character on a rooftop and says, ""So this level isn't as daunting as it seems. I just have to take it piece by piece."" He moves piles of cards around the map, shrinking and expanding them into different sizes, stacking them on top of one another. Rosenthal sees the paths clearly; he knows exactly where to go. This game is his creation, after all. Every move is obvious to him, and he navigates the game like a magician, seeing opportunities I can't. Where Cards Fall is a decidedly tricky puzzle game, asking players to visualize complicated paths forward and make the most of their physical resources. From across the circle, Snowman producer Eli Cymet chimes in: ""What I really like about it -- and I've talked to Sam about this a little bit before -- is that when people see screenshots or trailers, I think there's an inclination to say, 'Oh, this is kind of like Monument Valley.' And certainly that's a comparison we're honored to hear, but more actually for us it's kind of like Portal. Because you have to sort of just look at a space and imagine what the movement through that space might be, in your head, and then use the tools you have to create that movement."" Rosenthal agrees. ""Yeah, it's very much a game about spatial awareness and imagining what a space could be. We play with that with the story too. The main character ends up being an architect, which is a profession that very much deals with that as well."" He roams around the level, building more card houses, walking into a coffee shop and hanging out for a quiet moment on a bench, surveying the town. Eventually, a school bus comes into view. ""Now we're starting to see what's actually going on here. You're going to school,"" Rosenthal says. ""A lot of the time in Where Cards Fall , the aim of the characters isn't necessarily clear right at first. We want it to feel like the act of remembering. The puzzle-solving helps with that, but also, when we remember things, I think sometimes we remember what we're doing before why we're doing it. It's kind of meant to seem like that."" I'm not sure why -- perhaps the mention of ""school"" quietly activates a long-neglected region of my brain -- but I choose this moment, as the demo is wrapping up, to ask if there's a way to die in Where Cards Fall. ""No death at all,"" Rosenthal says. ""It's actually a really fun and interesting design challenge to work on a game where we couldn't use that as an escape. I always feel like it's important to justify any mechanic we include in the game, and if the characters are dying, we'd have to explain in the story why they're dying all the time. We didn't want to do that."" Where Cards Fall prides itself on minimalism and player input. The main character is ambiguous, allowing anyone to project their own psyche onto the model; the world itself is open to exploration without fear of death or a shrinking timer, letting players run wild while they build their card houses. There are no discrete levels and no on-screen prompts directing players along the way. However, the whole thing comes together beautifully, buoyed by a solid foundation: the puzzles themselves. No matter how fluidly Rosenthal flies through the suburbs, it's clear that these spatial riddles are complicated, requiring multiple steps and the ability to plan ahead. This is a tricky game. At one point in the middle of the playthrough, Rosenthal pauses for a moment and laughs. ""This demo typically takes about half an hour, but I'm just blazing through it."" He pinches and flicks and builds another card house. A new character opens the door from the inside. With a pinch, he collapses the structure and carries on.",gaming
Sean Buckley,Are your fingers small enough?,2017-03-21T09:41:00-04:00,Here is a tiny GameBoy emulator for your tiny Apple Watch screen,"The last place you'd probably want to play a video game is on an Apple Watch. The wearable has a tiny screen, almost no buttons and can only be operated with one hand. It's a completely impractical gaming device, but developer Gabriel O'Flaherty-Chan made a Game Boy emulator for it anyway. Named after Pokémon's Giovanni, the wrist-worn Game Boy emulator crams Nintendo's original gaming portable into an Apple Watch Series 2. It doesn't quite play games at full speed, but it is fully functional. On-screen buttons underneath the game display let users tap in start, select and B button inputs, and swiping up, down, left or right emulates the d-pad inputs. Want to press the A button? Just tap on the right side of the watch's face. The project is a fork of Gambatte, an existing Game Boy emulator -- but O'Flaherty-Chan says it wasn't an easy port. Apple's WatchOS didn't use any of the graphics standards the original emulator relied on, and was never really meant to play complex games. Still, the project is a neat proof of concept, albeit one that will never see full support on the App Store. Still, if you want to check it out for yourself, hit up the GitHub link at source link below. Giovanni is open-source, after all.",gaming
David Lumb,Get ready to box your springy-armed heart out.,2017-03-21T04:45:00-04:00,"Meet the first fighters of Nintendo's newest franchise, 'Arms'","The Switch blew us away when it launched earlier this month, but our enthusiasm for the console's possibilities has been tempered by its seriously limited game library. Lucky for you fighting game fans, brand-new 3D brawler Arms is coming to the console this spring. Nintendo dropped a pair of videos teasing a few characters and mechanics from the upcoming title, which looks about as gleefully competitive and bizarre as you'd expect a first-party Switch game to be. Brand-new IP Arms is a one-versus-one 3D fighting game that softens the genre's violence with spring-limbed punches and eccentric, colorful designs. The first five characters in its lineup fit its elastic theme: Spring Man, Ribbon Girl, Ninjara, Master Mummy and Mechanica. Each has their perks and drawbacks. The second video teases a few equippable power-ups that augment your fighter's punches with various effects. Boomerang gives a wide arc to your swings to circumvent obstacles, Sparky adds a zap to your punch and Revolver lets you throw three in a row. Clearly, Arms aims to be a lighter take on the fighting genre than the spine-shattering Mortal Kombat or the super serious Tekken. But what else would you expect from a company that lets you duel your friends in udder-milking?",gaming

Sean Buckley,The Nintendo 3DS doesn't infringe on Tomita's display patent.,2017-03-20T21:03:00-04:00,Federal appeals court upholds Nintendo's win in 3DS patent battle,"Just months after the Nintendo 3DS launched in 2011, it faced patent infringement allegations. Tomita Technologies was accusing Nintendo's new handheld of using its glasses-free 3D display technology without paying royalties. Like most patent lawsuits, it dragged on for years -- first awarding a victory to Tomita before handing the win to Nintendo in appeals. Now, a higher court has confirmed Nintendo's victory. On Friday, the Federal Circuit court ruled that the Nintendo 3DS does not infringe Tomita's patent. The question at hand was never if the 3DS allowed for glasses-free stereoscopic images, but rather how it joined the two perspectives of a 3D image to create the illusion of depth. The court used two tests to sort this out -- one that tested to see if the function itself was similar, and a second to determine if the differences between the methods were substantial. ""Under both tests,"" the court wrote in the ruling, ""the district court found that the 3DS and the disputed limitation do not possess equivalent structures."" In other words, the 3DS still offsets two images to create a 3D illusion, but not in a substantially similar way as Tomita's old patent. It's a big win for Nintendo, who would have had to pay $15.1 million in damages if its past victory had not been upheld.",gaming

As Nintendo 64 lovers know, the Hyrulian hero can use his instrument to do things like manipulate the rain and switch between night and day. In our realm, ocarinas just sound nice. Allen Pan, better known as Sufficiently Advanced on YouTube, decided he was tired of playing his ocarina without mystical results. So, he did what any Zelda fan with the technological know-how would do: create a smart home setup controlled by an ocarina. The system's hub is basically just a microphone connected to a Raspberry Pi. The device also features a light ring that indicates when it hears the ocarina and a speaker that plays the classic accomplishment chime when it recognizes an successful input. By playing songs from the game, Pan can control several WiFi-connected devices in his home, all of which seem to be homemade. It's not the cleanest setup we've seen, but this DIY smart home is pretty clever nonetheless. The songs trigger certain actions that correspond with their functions in the game, making for an intuitive system. For instance, ""Sun's Song"" turns on the lights, ""Song of Storms"" controls the humidifier, ""Bolero of Fire"" cranks up the heat, and so on. This down-and-dirty setup may not be as easy to use as Alexa or Google Home, but it looks like a lot more fun. As The Verge points out, though, this probably isn't the most secure IoT device. Security is a problem even with more established voice-controlled gadgets, so proceed with caution if you're thinking about recreating this system for yourself.",gaming

The Austin festival has unveiled its fourth annual gaming award winners, and the top picks definitely reflect SXSW's emphases on storytelling and out-of-the-ordinary concepts. The leader, by far, was Uncharted 4. Naughty Dog's swashbuckling action game took home five prizes, including video game of the year as well as excellence awards for a memorable character, narrative, animation and visuals. It's not surprising, to be honest -- U4 has been an awards darling for months, and its combination of sophisticated characterization with breathtaking vistas was bound to be appealing to SXSW's panel. Other big multi-award winners include Overwatch (eSports, most promising new property, multiplayer and trending), Battlefield 1 (sound effects and technical achievement) and Doom (gameplay and music). Dishonored 2 also claimed a design award, while the seemingly inescapable Pokémon Go was the mobile game of the year. Telltale's Batman series , meanwhile, won an award for converging the famous comic book hero with the studio's distinctive take on adventure gaming. However, the SXSW awards were as much about indies and fan-driven efforts as the mainstream. The Gamer's Voice awards went to the cult multiplayer favorite Arena Gods as well as the solo-oriented Owlboy , while the short-but-sweet Firewatch was the SXSW panel's art winner. The build-and-survive title Starbound was the most ""fulfilling"" community-backed game, and the special Matthew Crump Cultural Innovation Award went to the heartrending That Dragon, Cancer. Even a user mod got its due recognition, as the over-the-top Brutal Doom was the fan creation of the year. No, these titles didn't have much luck getting into SXSW's regular award categories, but they do illustrate that there's plenty of innovation outside of the mainstream.",gaming

No, not the 2013 Robin Thicke song, but the lines that separate reality from fantasy. This week started off with White House officials questioning the laws of physics when Counselor to the President Kellyanne Conway defended her boss's accusation via Twitter that former president Barack Obama had him wiretapped. ""What I can say is there are many ways to surveil each other now, unfortunately. There was an article this week that talked about how you can surveil someone through their phones -- certainly through their television sets, any number of different ways. And microwaves that turn into cameras, et cetera,"" Conway told the Bergen County Record's Mike Kelly in an interview. Microwaves that turn into cameras? The internet exploded. Our own Cherlynn Low debunked the baseless claim , and Conway, the mother of alternative facts, eventually admitted to CNN that she's ""not Inspector Gadget"" and doesn't ""believe people are using the microwave to spy on the Trump campaign."" This particular political flub may have generated a few good laughs, but it's just one in a series of examples that bring into focus the sometimes bizarre, often unreal reality many of us find ourselves in today. In 2017, truth isn't about facts -- it's about perception. As our coverage of SXSW 2017 shows, politics isn't the only arena where perception rules. This year, the excitement in Austin, Texas, didn't revolve around a hot new social app or politically charged panels. Instead, our attention was focused on how technology and art are merging to change the way we see the real world. Aaron Souppouris took us inside the Infinity Room , a stunning art installation that uses mirrors, sound and projection to create ""alternate realities""; Devindra Hardawar took an 8K, hydraulic-assisted ""virtual reality"" flight over Tokyo from inside the Austin Convention Center ; and Mona Lalwani explored new perspectives (see: all of them) in VR with Sony's experimental Superception. Whether you're looking at the battle over facts between the White House and the press or the ways in which technology is looking to alter our perception of the real world, it's clear that reality is on shaky ground.

Mat Smith,Avegant's Light Field adds a realistic depth-of-field effect to virtual objects.,2017-03-17T14:49:00-04:00,Focus is key to blending virtual objects with the real world,"You might remember Avegant for its unusual take on the video headset. The Glyph looked like (and doubled up as) headphone cans but worked pretty well. We called it ""a wearable cinema for serious movie fans."" Now, the startup is taking on a bigger challenge with Light Field, its ""mixed reality platform"" that can visualize objects ""at multiple focal planes"". That means that it can offer variably focused virtual objects in the real world. Until now, the inability to change focus has meant virtual objects appear out of place in the real world. Take a look at the image above: The Mars Rover in the hand is in the same position (and focus) as the hand, while Mars and the corridor behind are out of focus until that focus shifts. (Milanese Apple Watch band optional. We hope.) Avegant wants to make virtual objects appear more realistic at different distances. It also sounds like what investment-flush Magic Leap has been promising in recent years: more realistic virtual viewing and, most likely, the future of augmented reality. The company is planning on transforming this prototype into a consumer product. (Part of technology comes from its Glyph projector which projected an augmented reality screen for the wearer.) The technology this time is much more advanced, and offers more detailed projections. The company says this makes for a ""more realistic and interactive experience"". The technology will apparently work across multiple major hardware and software platforms. It doesn't specifically mention any VR (or AR) hardware makers, but it gives a nod to Unity , which is used to make an awful lot of current VR content. According to Kurt Guttag , a heads-up display expert that's had a play, the headset is bulkier than Microsoft's Hololens, but added that it was an engineering prototype. (He also got a behind-the-scenes play at CES, months ago in January. The hardware has almost certainly moved on since then.) Guttag said that the ability to see virtual objects in different focuses demonstrated that the tech was ""well beyond"" Hololens and its standard stereoscopic tech. Interestingly there's no moving parts to help focus the images — and it doesn't use eye-tracking either, apparently. While this means it's a bit of a mystery as to how it all works, Avegant says this helps to ensure it's ""economical to make"" — an important point to make when rival Magic Leap is dealing in billions of investment bucks. Edward Tang, co-founder and CTO at Avegant said: ""The biggest stumbling block for mixed reality today is creating crystal clear images that are within one meter. Without this capability, most mixed reality use cases simply can't materialize."" The team believes the tech can make its way into commercial and industrial uses, as well as offering more realistic entertainment and gaming experiences on the way. ""We've overcome that obstacle, and can't wait for people to experience the results,"" he added.",gaming

Buzz Aldrin, Apollo 11 astronaut, may now be 87, but he's keeping his mind focused on the next space frontier. For decades now, he's thought about how to get astronauts to Mars, becoming more vocal about his plans in recent years. He's also a fan of virtual reality as a medium to communicate his vision: He partnered with NASA to build a Mars Hololens experience last year, and now he's hosting a 10-minute VR experience that walks you through his vision of how to get to Mars.

While it has yet to release a prototype, we have a vague idea of what to expect from the company's previous work: the BAS-01G Soratnik. Weighing a fraction of the proposed new tank at just seven tons, the Soratnik is a machine gun mounted infantry support vehicle equipped with anti-tank missiles. With a top speed of 25 miles per hour, the mini-tank can be operated from a range of up to six miles and is even able to carry out certain tasks autonomously. Add warmth to your digital instruments.

Steve Dent,It's doubling production to 16 million units for 2017.,2017-03-17T04:43:00-04:00,WSJ: Nintendo is selling way more Switches than it expected,"We already knew that the Switch was Nintendo's fastest-selling console ever, but we now have an idea as to how many units it's pushing out. The WSJ says Nintendo plans to double production from 8 million units to 16 million for its 2017 fiscal year (starting in April) in order to keep up with higher-than-expected sales. Before it started shipping, analysts figured Nintendo would sell just 5 million units in its first year, due to the relatively high $300 price tag and lack of a free game with the console. However, strong early reviews and the widely-praised Zelda: Breath of the Wild launch title pushed sales to 1.5 million in the first week alone, and Nintendo could ship as many as 2.5 million units in the first month, the WSJ says. It's still pretty early to gauge demand for an entire year, obviously, and week two sales reportedly slowed dramatically in Japan after Nintendo shipped 329,152 Switches in the first seven days. However, that can likely be chalked up to supply problems, as the console is sold out almost everywhere around the world at the moment. If the WSJ report is accurate (and that's a big ""if,"" as it's based on anonymous supply chain sources), then that bodes well for sales later in the year and beyond. High enough numbers will motivate third-party developers to build games for the console in addition to (or instead of) other platforms like the PS4 and Xbox One. That in turn will drive further demand, ensuring that Switch sales remain strong after the early fervor dies down. After all, the Wii U sold around 3 million units in its first 6 weeks, but went on to sell just 13.5 million units total.",gaming

Sean Buckley,,2017-04-06T15:00:00-04:00,Explore Japanese gaming culture in 360 degrees with MatPat,"Matthew Patrick is best known as the guy on YouTube who uses math, science and rabid curiosity to build intense, unexpected narratives from the stray plot threads of movies and video games. As the Game Theorists' MatPat , he asks if Mario is secretly a sociopath and questions if Sega's blue hedgehog really is the fastest mascot in gaming -- and then backs up his allegations by covertly teaching viewers about actual psychology and the speed of sound. Now he's expanding his passion for making entertainment educational with a travel show called The Global Gamer. Oh, and he's doing it in 360-degree virtual reality -- and you can watch the launch exclusively right here on Engadget. The Global Gamer is one part passion for travel and one part YouTube content deal. ""It was a converging of a lot of worlds,"" Patrick told Engadget. The idea for a gamer-orientated travel show had been germinating in his mind for a while. ""My wife and I were really passionate about traveling internationally and experiencing new cultures,"" he said. ""If we could translate those experiences through the lens of gaming and get other people -- younger, digital-first audiences -- excited about learning about different cultures through the lens of gaming, that was kind of our goal with this series."" When Google approached The Game Theorists about working on a show for its Daydream initiative, The Global Gamer seemed like the perfect fit. With Google's 8K Jump VR cameras , the program could do more than just show gamers other cultures around the world -- it could bring them along for the ride. Despite the backing of Google's Daydream team, 360-degree video is a relatively new idea , and Patrick is well aware of its growing pains. ""Honestly, this whole thing is a big experiment,"" he says. From his work on the 360 segments of GameLab -- his YouTube Red show -- Patrick knows that VR videos have significantly lower engagement than traditional 2D viewing experiences. The audience just isn't sure how to approach the content. ""They start to suffer from decision fatigue,"" he says, ""and their minds start to wander because they have to be an active participant in the 360 experience. ""It goes to that whole idea that they're deciding what they're looking at at any given point,"" he says, likening the production of 360 video to directing for the theatrical stage. The camera captures everything around the scene, not just its focal point. ""You can't necessarily control where the audience is looking at any given moment, but you always want to have a clear throughline of action or movement or sound to guide them."" The Global Gamer does this by deftly balancing the 360-VR experience with a more traditional viewing paradigm. Yes, this travel adventure is best when viewed through a phone or browser to explore the 360 environment, or, better still, in a VR headset like Daydream -- but if you pull the video up on a TV, you won't miss out on the core experience. If the subject of a scene walks out of view, something appropriate almost always fills the space, be it a bisected scene that matches the ongoing narration, a graphic that illustrates the point or just a pop-up window in the center of the screen showing viewers what they would be seeing if they had followed the subject out of frame. This makes the content work without the 360 trick, but it's still an experience tailor-made for immersive viewing. Patrick's journey between the shrines and cultural practices of old Japan and the arcades and fashion worlds of modern Japan is cut so the viewer almost feels like she's hanging out with a friend in a tour group. As the video walks through the busy marketplace of Senso-Ji temple, the viewer has the option to look away from Patrick's narration and explore the shops, admire the shrine architecture or watch the tourists gawk at the 360 camera driving the experience -- all while listening in on the conversation of her digital peers. ""It's our hope and our goal that we were able to create something that's compelling enough to get people excited about immersing themselves for that long of a period, with each episode being 20 minutes or so."" Patrick admits that's a long time, but stresses the importance of figuring out how to make a 360 documentary format that works for long sessions. If it turns out that the show can't keep viewers hooked for that long, The Global Gamer may fall back to a traditional format, but the immersive elements aren't going away. ""If we do end up seeing that, a 20-minute watch session for an episode is still a lot to ask of a viewer right now with the technology currently as it is, let's dial that back to a more traditional 2D and select a really great couple of shots from the shrine, or put them in the middle of a kendo battle... either way, it works for the format. It's really just kind of basing it off what the audience is ready for."" In any case, Patrick doesn't see the series ending anytime soon, even if he does tweak the format. ""At this point, gaming is an international language,"" he says. ""But the way that individual cultures choose to game really says a lot. The types of games they like to play really says a lot about their cultural backgrounds."" For Japan, the show explored the roots of Japanese culture and how that connects to rhythm games, but Patrick has plenty of other ideas -- including a look behind South Korea's thriving eSports industry , how Brazil's love of football ties into a culture built up around FIFA video games, and how Australia's strict censorship laws drastically change the gaming experience for locals. ""These stories have never been told because gaming was never really considered a serious topic of research and exploration and, quite frankly, cultural identity,"" Patrick said. The popularity of online programming around games is changing that, however. ""It's an interesting filter to look at all these different countries."" MatPat's Global Gamer can be found on The Game Theorists YouTube channel , with the first episode debuting right here on Engadget.",vr

Nick Summers,"For $6.99, you can choose five VR apps and swap them out every month.",2017-04-03T09:00:00-04:00,HTC launches a monthly subscription for Vive VR apps,"Virtual reality is still in its infancy, so it's no surprise that most apps for the HTC Vive are smaller, experimental and ultimately expendable experiences. If you're a new headset owner, it can be hard to know which games are worth buying, or to get a good sense of what the medium has to offer without spending hundreds of dollars. To help, HTC is launching the Viveport Subscription, a scheme that offers five VR apps for $6.99 per month. You choose from a pool of 50 and can rotate your selection every four weeks, keeping your library and knowledge of the platform fresh. The subscription service launches on April 5th, and everyone will receive a one-month free trial. Compatible apps include the physics puzzler Fantastic Contraption , Everest VR , Richie's Plank Experience and ocean exploration TheBlu. The hope, of course, is that you'll maintain a subscription and buy the experiences that leave an impression each month. That way, you can keep trying new software while holding on to the apps you think are interesting and warrant periodical play sessions. HTC is launching Viveport Subscription as a way to mark the Vive's first anniversary. As an extra gift, it's giving away Arcade Saga , a three-game package that normally costs $19.99 on Steam. If you haven't bought a Vive yet, the company is also knocking $100 off the standard retail price. That should make it a tad more competitive with the Oculus Rift, which received a similar price-cut last month , and Sony's PlayStation VR , a cheaper but slightly less powerful alternative. The current wave of VR has had a slow, but steady start -- while its smartphone division suffers , HTC needs to ensure the Vive remains competitive and, therefore, attractive to consumers and developers.

Timothy J.

Following the news that he'd donated $10,000 to a group spreading pro-Trump memes , the 24-year old had increasingly shied away from the public eye. That even went as far as skipping last October's Oculus Connect event so as not to be a ""distraction"" to the news coming out of the conference. In 2014 , Facebook purchased Oculus VR for $2 billion, drawing huge amounts of attention to both VR and PalmerLuckey personally. In the last year, the company had to battle legal cases that involving both Luckey and John Carmack.

Devindra Hardawar,,2017-03-30T13:25:00-04:00,'Rock Band VR' is the dorkiest game ever and I love it,"Rock Band VR will make you feel like a rock star. But from the outside, you'll look like a crazy person with an Oculus Rift on your head and a plastic guitar in your hands, strumming along in silence. Basically, you'll look like a huge dork while playing it. But the embarrassment is worth it: Rock Band VR successfully captures the feeling of actually playing music in front of a crowd. Even though it's Harmonix's first stab at virtual reality, the end result is immersive and, most importantly, fun. While music games are still around -- Rock Band 4 was released in 2015 -- it's clear that their heyday is over. Guitar Hero brought plastic guitars into living rooms around the world, and the Rock Band series did the same with more instruments (a drum kit, keyboard and microphone). But given that it's been more than a decade since the first Guitar Hero debuted, it was about time we saw a new spin on music games. The biggest issue with Rock Band VR is getting started. To play it, you'll need an Oculus Rift and Touch Controllers ($600 bundled together), a gaming PC rig and a Rock Band 4 guitar. Harmonix is selling bundles of the game along with an Xbox One or PS4 guitar for $70, which is useful if, like me, you've already dumped all of your plastic gaming instruments. You'll also need to slot an Oculus Touch controller on top of the guitar for motion tracking. Oculus includes a small dock for Rock Band guitars with every Touch controller, but hopefully it will also be sold separately. Since I wasn't planning to review Rock Band VR when I first set up the Touch Controllers last year, I completely lost track of that dock. You can, however, still play the game by letting the Touch controller sit at the base of the guitar neck. Unfortunately, despite being called Rock Band VR , the game only supports guitar play right now. There's also no multiplayer support yet, though there's room for that to be added down the line. On top of being a virtual reality experience that lets you see your bandmates and a crowd in front of you, Rock Band VR completely reinvents how you play Rock Band. Instead of trying to hit different notes during a song, it's focused entirely on playing different chords. That involves holding down chord keys and strumming on a guitar rather than trying to hit colored buttons. It's a far less punishing experience than previous games. In fact, it's pretty much impossible to fail a song. Even if you do badly, you just earn fewer points. But while it might seem like a cakewalk at first, there's a learning curve if you want to play the game properly. It takes time to learn different chord combos, which helps you score higher. And there are higher-difficulty settings that introduce things like chord progression. Ultimately, it's much more fulfilling than just hitting notes in sync with a song. (If you miss the old gameplay format, you can get your fix in ""classic mode."") I found myself jamming out for hours at a time, whereas earlier Rock Band and Guitar Hero games have left me frustrated after failing songs. More than any other title from Harmonix, Rock Band VR lets you live out the fantasy of actually being a rocker -- especially during the crazy guitar-shredding solos. It even gives you extra points for head banging! The game is an ideal VR experience: The creepy virtual audience actually makes eye contact with you and gets revved up as you play better, and the chord chart appears right above the crowd. There's also something cool about being onstage alongside virtual bandmates. You can also lean into any mic onstage to speak to the audience or follow along with a song. Still, Rock Band VR shares most of the downsides of virtual reality too. It's a lot harder to enjoy with an audience, since you're experiencing it in a headset with headphones. You can always configure the sound to come out of your speakers and show off the game window on a TV or monitor, but that works best if you somehow have the Oculus Rift set up in your living room. The game ships with 60 songs from the likes of Aerosmith, David Bowie and DragonForce, and as usual, you'll eventually be able to snag more through DLC. There are plenty of solid bundled tracks for rock fans, though depending on your tastes, there are likely a few you'll never play. And no, you can't bring over your existing Rock Band song library. For all of its faults, Rock Band VR succeeds by getting the big things right. It completely revitalizes the aging music-game genre, and it's one of the first titles I'd recommend to anyone with an Oculus Rift. It lets you live out all of your teenage musical fantasies -- as long as you don't mind looking like a huge geek.",vr
Devindra Hardawar,The mobile Oculus Home experience is also getting some upgrades.,2017-03-29T11:00:00-04:00,Samsung's new Gear VR and controller arrive on April 21st for $129,"While the VR war between the Oculus Rift and HTC Vive is getting most of the hype, the competition in mobile VR is a far bigger deal for most consumers. After all, you only need a phone and a cheap headset for mobile VR, not a powerful gaming rig and lots of spending money. Samsung's Gear VR cemented itself as a pioneer in the market over the past few years, but Google's Daydream View headset came out swinging last year with the inclusion of a small motion-sensing remote. Samsung is ready to fight back with a refined headset and mobile motion controller of its own. As part of its Galaxy S8 event today, Samsung announced that the new Gear VR will be available on April 21st for $129. Current Gear VR owners can also nab the controller separately for $39. While the Gear VR is still far less than the $600 you'd have to shell out for the Oculus Rift or Vive, it's more than the $80 price for either the previous model or the Daydream View. But Samsung might be able to justify that premium with a slightly better mobile VR experience. I had a chance to try out the new controller with an older Gear VR, and I was surprised by how comfortable it was. The motion tracking felt fairly accurate, but mostly I was struck by how it felt in my hand. It has a slightly angled orientation, and your fingers naturally fall on the large trackpad on top and the trigger button on the back. That trigger, by the way, differentiates it from the Daydream View remote, which only has a trackpad and a few buttons. It makes the controller more in line with the Oculus Touch and Vive gamepads, and it's a big help for most VR shooting titles. Beyond the new hardware, Oculus also updated its Oculus Home experience for the Gear VR. It boots up much faster than before, so you're not left staring at a black screen when you put on the headset. You'll also notice that Oculus Home looks much clearer than it did in the past. It's now easier to read text, thanks to a doubled pixel resolution. To show that feature off, Oculus also added a VR web browser, which was able to render Engadget and other major websites with no issue. Most importantly, the website text looked good enough to read within the Gear VR.",vr
Richard Lai,"Cinemas and arcades can also take advantage of this, but it's China-only for now.",2017-03-29T05:17:00-04:00,HTC targets the classroom with 10-headset Vive bundle,"The folks over at HTC Vive have been talking up the potential of VR in education since day one, and this year, they're hoping to make a bigger push into this space by focusing on multi-user scenarios. At this week's Vive Ecosystem Conference in Shenzhen, the company announced the Vive Group Edition bundle for China, which includes ten Business Edition headsets plus two Business Edition base stations for 49,999 yuan or about $7,260, and it's due to ship in May. This offers a much lower entry barrier for commercial users, as it's almost a 40-percent saving when compared to buying ten full Business Edition kits, meaning schools and small businesses are more likely to afford the system. For those who are wondering, yes, the Group Edition package is missing the controllers plus extra base stations, and for a good reason. According to the company, the idea here stemmed from a growing number of customer requests for high-end multi-user VR solutions, but that quickly becomes costly as each headset needs to be hooked up to a relatively powerful PC. As such, the only way to lower the cost without too much compromise is by sticking to the bare necessities on the VR side: a number of headsets and just two base stations per room. While the lack of controllers here may sound worrying, HTC Vive's China President Alvin Wang Graylin assured me that the lean kit is perfectly suitable for light interaction use cases. These can be as simple as watching a video together (so cinemas can also take advantage of this package) to something more fun like going on virtual tours -- be it a seated experience or a room-scale experience. I can imagine students enjoying geography, biology and history lessons more by being virtually transported to different places, and they'll also get a better sense of scale by walking around an animated solar system; these can all get by without controllers, and Graylin added that there are plenty more of such education VR apps in the works. But of course, customers can always add controllers to their Group Edition orders should their budget allow. This then opens up more opportunities in the classroom. During the conference, HTC showed off a chemistry lesson app which let teachers and students do virtual experiments together using controllers. It may take the fun out of seeing real chemicals fizzing or burning away, but this way the class gets to simulate the more dangerous experiments with no actual risks. Another somewhat educational app that caught my attention during the conference -- and I know I'm late to this one -- was Night Cafe: A VR Tribute to Vincent Van Gogh (available on Steam ), which lets you explore a tranquil world rendered in the style of Van Gogh's painting, and you even get to meet the man himself. Had this technology been available earlier, I might have paid more attention in my art lessons back then. Graylin also addressed some concerns regarding whether VR is bad for children's eyes. Earlier this year, his company partnered with the Beijing Institute of Technology to study a group of young subjects aged 9 to 12. First, the children each wore a VR headset (presumably a Vive) for 20 minutes, and the result was that 8 percent of them reportedly had worse vision afterwards. But in a second test involving the use of tablets instead of VR headsets, the percentage of subjects with worsened vision went up to 11.5 percent. What's more interesting is that in the VR test, 20 percent of the subjects actually had improved vision, which was notably higher than the mere 7.7 percent in the tablet test. So in short, VR usage appears to be more beneficial -- or at least less harmful -- to children's eyes than using tablets, but we should take this claim with a grain of salt until more studies come to the same conclusion. Having said that, there are already existing apps that use VR to help restore vision, namely Vivid Vision (formerly Diplopia ), Visionize and IrisVision. It's obviously a bit early to tell whether the Vive Group Edition bundle has the right formula, but Graylin has already set an aggressive target for the education sector in China. Currently, there are ""dozens"" of local schools that have partnered with HTC Vive, and the exec hopes to turn this figure ""into hundreds or even thousands"" by the end of this year. If all goes well, here's hoping other markets will also be offered a similar package to increase VR adoption.",vr
Steve Dent,"Using consumer headsets, astronauts can simulate maintenance, exercise and more.",2017-03-27T03:41:00-04:00,NASA trains astronauts with zero-G virtual reality,"To train ISS astronauts, NASA uses physical mockups, zero-G "" vomit comet "" airplane rides, neutral buoyancy (underwater) and other pricey and complex schemes. However, virtual reality has become a new option, allowing astronauts to do realistic training for things like maintenance in an accurate, simulated zero-G environment. The company that helped them build the sim, Epic Games' Unreal Engine, recently unveiled a video showing exactly how that works. NASA recently teamed with Oculus on Mission:ISS , a consumer education VR experience aboard the ISS. However, the training SIM NASA is developing with Unreal Engine is different altogether, and they appear to be using both the Oculus Rift and HTC's Vive headsets. The setup uses ""cutting edge graphics and physics simulations to increase the sense of presence,"" says NASA Software Engineer Matthew Noyes. ""The more realistic the training feels, the faster you can respond in real-world, critical situations, which could save your mission or even your life."" As Ars Technica noted after trying it out earlier this month, the VR is realistic enough that it can even simulate blooming. When you look up at the digital ""sky,"" your pupils must dilate before you can see any stars, the same thing astronauts experience in space. NASA ISS astronauts that have tried the sim say it closely matches what it feels like to handle objects in zero G. The training includes simulated maintenance, letting you use the Vive's control wand to grab tools and other objects aboard the ISS. To make the mixed-reality simulation of gravity even more immersive, it also works with an ""active response gravity offload system"", basically a crane that flies astronauts around to simulate zero, lunar or Mars gravity. While this is still an (incomplete) NASA simulation, Noyes told Ars that the sim team was also working on a public release, though no dates have been discussed. The idea would be to create both a public outreach product alongside an actual SIM -- something that might both inspire an train young wannabe astronauts.",vr
Jon Fingas,It may also launch pure electronics stores.,2017-03-26T18:28:00-04:00,Amazon considers opening augmented reality furniture stores,"Amazon's retail plans could extend well beyond books and groceries. New York Times sources hear that the internet giant is ""exploring"" the possibility of appliance and furniture stores with a technological angle. You'd use augmented or virtual reality to see how items would look in your own home, making it easier to pull the trigger on that new couch or stove. And there's a chance that Amazon might challenge some of its tech rivals more directly in retail, too. Reportedly, Amazon is mulling an electronics store that would be similar in concept to Apple's shops. While Amazon's bookstores already carry some of its devices, these would have a ""heavy emphasis"" on hardware and services like Echo speakers and Prime Video. The Times is quick to point out that talking about stores isn't the same as definitive plans. There's a chance that Amazon will scrap the ideas if they prove to be unworkable. Even if that happens, this still shows just how much Amazon's philosophy has changed over the years. It was originally known for rendering physical stores obsolete -- now, it seems bent on reinvigorating retail by using its internet expertise as an advantage. The furniture and electronics stores in particular would represent an admission that shoppers still want hands-on time with products when possible, even if they're happy to purchase online.",vr

For the 2017 tournament that's already in progress, the college sports governing body is teaming up with Turner Sports and CBS Sports to offer VR streaming of not only those final three games, but of the Sweet 16 and Elite 8 as well. Those two rounds begin this Thursday, March 23rd and run through the weekend. The live games will be available from the March Madness VR app inside the Oculus store that's available for download today. Once inside, you'll need to buy a ""premium ticket"" to watch the immersive action on the hardwood for $2 or $3 per game. For the cost of admission, you'll get a virtual courtside seat where you can expect multiple camera angles, sound from inside the arena and dedicated commentary on the pricier Gold level. If you want to pay up all six games for this tier, you can hand over $8 to do just that. At $2 per game, you'll get access to a single 180-degree camera angle and the regular CBS broadcast commentary from Jim Nantz and crew at the Silver level. The tech that drives the whole thing is Intel's True VR, formerly known as the live events-focused virtual reality setup from Voke, a small company that the chipmaker purchased late last year. Intel says that with Voke's technology it can use VR to offer both live and on-demand games and highlights that will ""bring the in-stadium experience to life from any location."" If you'll recall, Voke powered the March Madness virtual reality streams in 2016. True VR will employ so-called pods that contain a dozen cameras each for the Sweet 16 and Elite 8. The plan for those two rounds is to use up to 48 cameras for the games. For the Final Four and championship game, Intel is bumping that total up to 84. This is only the beginning of VR events with the NCAA, Intel, Turner and CBS. Part of today's news is that this year's March Madness coverage is the start of a multi-year deal between all four with Intel being named the exclusive VR live games partner of the NCAA.

Jon Fingas,Virtual games could become that much more realistic.,2017-03-20T17:45:00-04:00,Disney shows how you catch a real ball in VR,"It's relatively easy to boost the immersiveness of virtual reality by giving you gloves or props. But how would you have someone catch a real ball when they can't see where it's going? Disney Research has an answer: its scientists have developed a motion capture system that lets you grab a ball just as intuitively in VR as you would without a headset. Their approach uses sensors to track the movement of your hands, your head and the ball -- after that, it's a matter of using a motion prediction method to visualize where the ball is going. Even in its early form, the system is both effective and flexible. Testers had little trouble catching the ball in a conventional way, where they only saw where the ball was at any given moment, but they could also catch it when they were shown either the trajectory or a predicted target area. There are no immediate plans to put this into software you can use, but you can spot the practical applications from a mile away. You could build VR apps where catching and throwing are not only more realistic, but easier for those without keen instincts. A catching game could teach rookies how to anticipate the ball's path, rather than expecting them to learn through trial and error. While there would be limits to this (you wouldn't want to have VR players whipping fastballs), it would expand the range of possible VR activities.",vr

Mat Smith,Avegant's Light Field adds a realistic depth-of-field effect to virtual objects.,2017-03-17T14:49:00-04:00,Focus is key to blending virtual objects with the real world,"You might remember Avegant for its unusual take on the video headset. The Glyph looked like (and doubled up as) headphone cans but worked pretty well. We called it ""a wearable cinema for serious movie fans."" Now, the startup is taking on a bigger challenge with Light Field, its ""mixed reality platform"" that can visualize objects ""at multiple focal planes"". That means that it can offer variably focused virtual objects in the real world. Until now, the inability to change focus has meant virtual objects appear out of place in the real world. Take a look at the image above: The Mars Rover in the hand is in the same position (and focus) as the hand, while Mars and the corridor behind are out of focus until that focus shifts. (Milanese Apple Watch band optional. We hope.) Avegant wants to make virtual objects appear more realistic at different distances. It also sounds like what investment-flush Magic Leap has been promising in recent years: more realistic virtual viewing and, most likely, the future of augmented reality. The company is planning on transforming this prototype into a consumer product. (Part of technology comes from its Glyph projector which projected an augmented reality screen for the wearer.) The technology this time is much more advanced, and offers more detailed projections. The company says this makes for a ""more realistic and interactive experience"". The technology will apparently work across multiple major hardware and software platforms. It doesn't specifically mention any VR (or AR) hardware makers, but it gives a nod to Unity , which is used to make an awful lot of current VR content. According to Kurt Guttag , a heads-up display expert that's had a play, the headset is bulkier than Microsoft's Hololens, but added that it was an engineering prototype. (He also got a behind-the-scenes play at CES, months ago in January. The hardware has almost certainly moved on since then.) Guttag said that the ability to see virtual objects in different focuses demonstrated that the tech was ""well beyond"" Hololens and its standard stereoscopic tech. Interestingly there's no moving parts to help focus the images — and it doesn't use eye-tracking either, apparently. While this means it's a bit of a mystery as to how it all works, Avegant says this helps to ensure it's ""economical to make"" — an important point to make when rival Magic Leap is dealing in billions of investment bucks. Edward Tang, co-founder and CTO at Avegant said: ""The biggest stumbling block for mixed reality today is creating crystal clear images that are within one meter. Without this capability, most mixed reality use cases simply can't materialize."" The team believes the tech can make its way into commercial and industrial uses, as well as offering more realistic entertainment and gaming experiences on the way. ""We've overcome that obstacle, and can't wait for people to experience the results,"" he added.",vr

Devindra Hardawar,,2017-03-15T16:30:00-04:00,This 8K 'VR' ride is the craziest thing I saw at SXSW,"When I heard that several Japanese companies were getting together to show off an 8K VR ride at SXSW, I was instantly excited. I've spent a lot of time writing about 4K video but haven't had much time with 8K setups, let alone one in VR. After getting to the show though, I learned it isn't really a VR experience -- it just takes place on a giant screen that fills up everything you can see. I quickly got over that slight disappointment after seeing the crazy rig powering the ride, which looks like something straight out of Disney World. As far as weird SXSW experiences go, this one takes the cake. Japan's NHK Enterprises, NHK Media Tech, RecoChoku and Victor Entertainment worked together to build the ride, which is meant to show off the possibilities of 8K video. NHK is already broadcasting a few 8K channels , even though TVs supporting the technology likely won't arrive until 2020. The ride is powered by Wonder Vision's Sphere 5.2 Immersive Screen, which uses hydraulics to pick up two audience members and fully immerse them in the screen. Backing the entire experience is the infuriatingly catchy song Tokyo Victory from the popular Japanese rock group Southern All Stars. As I stepped into the ride, it felt just like climbing onto something you'd find at a theme park. After securing my seatbelt, I was lifted several feet in the air. It was at that point that I realized I wasn't very secure in my seat, so I also spent much of the time holding on for dear life. The ride mostly consists of flybys of major Tokyo landmarks, but because it was projected in a brightly lit convention center, I couldn't actually see much. I have a feeling the entire experience would have been significantly more rewarding if they just blocked out external light. The bits I could actually see looked clear, but it was definitely not the best way to show off the potential of 8K. I've seen 8K demos at CES that look as clear as staring through a window. If these Japanese companies really want to see us on the idea of 8K, they should probably invest in some curtains. Click here to catch up on the latest news from SXSW 2017.",vr

It'll even show you how a VR program runs at different detail levels, so you'll know if you need to tone down the graphics setting to get optimal performance. You're most likely to find use for this as a gamer, since it's an easy way to gauge whether or not your PC is fast enough to handle that hot new VR experience.

Jon Fingas,New projection techniques improve detail in meaningful ways.,2017-03-15T11:42:00-04:00,YouTube boosts the quality of online VR video,"When you stream VR video online, you usually have to sacrifice visual quality. There's a lot more data, so something has to give. However, that isn't stopping Google's YouTube and Daydream groups from improving what you see. They're introducing a new projection technique, the equi-angular cubemap (EAC), that promises to increase the practical level of detail for 360-degree footage. Where conventional methods produce pictures that are only sharp in certain areas, EAC is extremely consistent -- it distributes an equal number of pixels across all angle changes. It may not be as theoretically sharp in certain areas, but there are no glaring weak points. Google wants to help others improve VR projections, too. To that end, it's proposing a Projection Independent Mesh standard that would simply tell a video player how to project the raw VR info. The approach would use extremely small amounts of data (just 4KB for EAC), so it wouldn't require gobs of bandwidth or new hardware. You can find a draft version of the standard on GitHub. At the moment, you'll have to use an Android device to watch videos that use EAC. Desktop and iOS viewing is coming later, Google says. And unless it's a specially optimized video, you probably won't see it -- YouTube still ingests clips based on a conventional projection format. This upgrade is more about the long-term future of VR rather than an immediate upgrade.",vr
Devindra Hardawar,Hot Sugar breaks new ground again with 'The Melody of Dust.',2017-03-15T10:35:00-04:00,How one artist is reinventing the music album with VR,"Nick Koenig is no stranger to musical innovation. The artist, better known as Hot Sugar, has been dabbling in the art of associative music since his teens. As he describes it, the technique involves taking found sounds and ""manipulating them into more."" Basically, he can turn just about anything into music. Now with The Melody of Dust , a new project coproduced with Viacom NEXT and premiering at SXSW this week, he's taking that concept into virtual reality. We've seen music videos and other experiences in VR -- most famously from Bjork , one of the most tech-savvy artists working today. But this is notable for being the primary method of hearing an album, instead of a separate VR project. And no, it's not as easy as just hitting ""play."" The Melody of Dust starts in a castle-like room. Since it's an HTC Vive experience, your first instinct is to start walking around and interacting with the space. Pretty quickly you'll notice that just about every object you can pick up -- be it a bird, a glass or a vase -- produces a different tone. After some time, a vortex erupts in the room, and you can throw those objects in. For every three things that you toss, you get a different melody. None of this is spelled out for you. Like a good adventure game, it's up to you to explore The Melody of Dust. Once you've loaded up the vortex enough, you get to hear one of 87 different songs Koenig mixed for the experience. As you can probably guess, the song you get depends on what you've actually thrown in. ""I'm looking at it as a new music listening experience,"" Koenig said. ""It's like jumping into a new venue for listening to the music."" While he's planning to release a traditional album with 13 of the experience's songs, Koenig sees The Melody of Dust as his true new album. It's not the most visually rich experience I've seen, but it's conceptually fascinating. I played through it without hearing about Koenig's grand vision for the future of interactive music, but even without that philosophical setup I still enjoyed exploring the environment and hearing the sounds every object created. I was relying on pure intuition and the minor triggers from the game, but I still got a sense of what Koenig was aiming for. It's the sort of thing that would reward a few plays through it, especially once you know that you're supposed to experiment to hear new songs. ""The technology is constantly evolving; 360-degree video to Vive is already a whole different thing,"" Koenig said when I asked him about his thoughts on VR's potential as a new medium. ""As this continues developing, the future of most media will be some iteration of this sort of thing... That's why we're not afraid of jumping the gun and doing an album on a platform most music fans don't even own. I have faith in a few years it'll be just as relevant, or at least unique."" Given the expense and scarcity of VR equipment, there's a good chance most of Hot Sugar's fans will hear The Melody of Dust album without even catching a whiff of the virtual component. But Koenig doesn't seem too concerned about that. He's more interested in trying something new than being traditional. And with The Melody of Dust , he has a shot at being a pioneer in a whole new medium. Click here to catch up on the latest news from SXSW 2017.",vr

Then you can use the slate to navigate around the store and hopefully find exactly what you're looking for in no time flat. It's something Lowe's showed off recently in tandem with a VR project to illustrate how tech can make DIY easier. One example is showing trepidatious customers what it'll be like to tile a shower without actually getting their hands dirty. ""From mixing the mortar to laying the pattern, the simulation walks the user through each step of the process,"" the press release reads. So far, the franchise says that its limited tests have been successful at boosting customers' confidence at tackling do-it-yourself projects, well, themselves. In the video below, Kyle Nel, executive director of Lowe's Innovation Labs, says that versus someone who only watched a YouTube how-to video, customers who went through the Holoroom How-To program had 36 percent better recall of the skills they learned. ""People learn by doing,"" he says. ""It's just how we're built."" The next step is analyzing feedback from this larger test pool before potentially adding the tech to more stores. If you're in Framingham, Massachusetts you can check out the latest version of Holoroom right now. Lowe's says that customers in Burlington, Canada and Beloeil, Quebec will be able to demo the VR experience over the next ""several weeks.""

Devindra Hardawar,It uses Hubble images to transport you to the Orion Nebula.,2017-03-14T16:20:00-04:00,'Fistful of Stars' lets you experience a stellar birth in VR,"There may be no better way to show off the possibilities of virtual reality than by exploring the cosmos. We've already seen some early space experiences, like Adr1ft , but you can expect artists to keep experimenting as the VR ecosystem matures. Fistful of Stars, which debuts this week at SXSW , is an ambitious attempt at pushing VR space experiences forward. It launches you into the heart of the Orion Nebula, where you see a star being born up close. It's the sort of thing space nerds have always dreamed of, but it's also intriguing enough for anyone to enjoy (and hopefully learn a thing or two). Fistful of Stars started out as part of The Hubble Cantata , a live performance that took place in Brooklyn's Prospect Park last summer. Six thousand people in the audience wore Google Cardboard headsets and stepped through the Orion Nebula as a way to show how VR, something that's typically seen as isolating, could also be a social group experience. While they were on their virtual field trip, they were serenaded by a 20-piece orchestra and 100-person choir. The current version of Fistful of Stars has been improved since its initial run, said director Eliza McNitt, and it's backed by a 3D audio recording of The Hubble Cantata. ""I chose the Orion Nebula because it's the birthplace of stars,"" she said. ""I wanted to be able to take people on a journey into space."" While this is her first VR film, McNitt is renowned for her work in films and documentaries, including Artemis Falls, a TED-commissioned short about a young astronaut traveling into space. She's releasing Fistful of Stars together with Vice and Samsung in June for the Gear VR. It's a fairly short VR experience, but Fistful of Stars still makes a big impact. You start off orbiting Earth and end up traveling to the Orion Nebula through the Hubble telescope. The experience is based on Hubble imagery, and it's rendered with a loving realism. It feels more like you're drifting through space than staring at a computer rendering. I was lucky enough to sit through Fistful of Stars in a state-of-the-art screening room covered in speakers, which made it feel like I was reliving a scene from 2001: A Space Odyssey. SXSW attendees will get a similar experience in private screening rooms. You can still expect it to sound impressive when you're experiencing it through headphones though. Once I got to the point where I was witnessing the creation of a star in the Orion Nebula, rendered as a fiery marvel, it was hard not to feel a bit emotional. Fistful of Stars is an ideal VR showcase not only because it's a technical marvel but also because it makes you reflect on your own place in the cosmos.

With only a few surviving androids left on Earth, the story follows the robotic resistance as they take a stand against the all-powerful singularity threatening to destroy them. After speaking about the challenges of filming in VR, producer John Hamilton promises that Trinity will be an experience which allows 'viewers to move around an episode in a way that hasn't been seen before'. The live-action series will be split into five fifteen minute episodes and is to be released on all available virtual reality platforms. In order to create an experience that it deemed immersive enough, UNLTD opted to develop its own proprietary camera to film Trinity. Combining a mix of high-end visual effects, interactive engines and 360 scripting, we can get a brief glimpse into the aesthetic of the ambitious sci-fi with the 2D teaser trailer below. With most VR content dividing userbases thanks to money-hatting from hardware manufacturers , it's nice to see projects becoming more platform agnostic.

The liquid-fueled RS-25 is an updated version of the Space Shuttle's main engines (not the side-mounted boosters) that, in total, will pump out about a quarter of the SLS's 8.8 million pounds of thrust. When the rocket is launched, the motors will fire non-stop for about 8.5 minutes, powering the Orion capsule into orbit and well, well beyond.

Jon Fingas,'The Persistence' takes an unusual approach to multiplayer VR.,2017-03-13T03:14:00-04:00,PlayStation VR horror title lets friends mess with your game,"Most solo virtual reality games don't make for great entertainment at parties... not unless your definition of fun involves making everyone wait their turn. Firesprite, however, has a way for your friends to join in. Its upcoming PlayStation VR sci-fi horror title The Persistence will include a mobile companion app that lets nearby friends see the game map. Your pals can make your life easier by steering you toward items, or create havoc by running you toward threats -- this is one of the few horror games where the people on your couch may be as much of a hazard as the virtual enemies. There are a few other twists that could help The Persistence stand out. The ill-fated ship is procedurally generated with each new life, so you can't play the game by memory. And there are accommodations for VR beyond the phone app, too, such as teleportation. If there's a problem at this early stage, it's that there's no known release date. You could be waiting quite a while to see whether the promising concept works well in practice.",vr
Nathan Ingraham,,2017-03-12T20:56:00-04:00,What it's like playing 'Rez Infinite' strapped into a synesthesia suit,"At SXSW last year, Sony showed off a bunch of unusual and intriguing prototypes from its Future Lab division. In 2017, the company is going even bigger: A huge space called the Wow Factory has stuff from the Future Lab as well as a whole host of immersive VR experiences. I tried a couple out, and the best way I can describe my reaction is confused but intrigued. The first was space / music shooter Rez Infinite in PlayStation VR. But In addition to wearing a headset, I was strapped in to a ""synesthesia suit"" that had a host of haptic feedback sensors built in. Once I was fully set up, I jumped into the game, and the whole thing was rather overwhelming. There's just way more to concentrate on than there is in most games. I was in a 360-degree space trying to find all the enemies while music blasted into my headphones and the suit vibrated in time with the game. It was hard to identify exactly what the vibrations were supposed to sync up to, though. Sometimes it was music; other times it was shots hitting the enemy ships. Once I stopped overthinking and just let myself enjoy the game, it was all good -- but I also don't know how much the suit really added to the experience. Everyone loves Rez Infinite , and it works great in VR, and that's enough for me. Across from the Rez Infinite experience was a Resident Evil booth where I was suited up in another haptic feedback outfit. This one was less complicated; it was more of a vest than a full-body suit. From there, a fake but semi-realistic gun was placed in my hands, and a giant, wall-sized 3D display lit up in front of me. With my 3D glasses and automatic weapon in place, the screen lit up with a few of a ravaged city street filled with zombies that wanted to tear me to pieces. I started blasting down the slow-moving creepers that were a good distance away, but then some dead bodies closer to me came to life -- that's when the 3D effects were put to good use. A few zombies near me ""came out"" of the screen as I blasted away at them, downing the menaces in the nick of time. I wasn't so lucky when a few zombie-dogs sprinted out of the pack and attacked me. Each hit made the vest reverberate with the impact something that was amped up when a giant ""boss"" zombie came running down the street at me. The gun conveniently locked up and I was shredded to death, with the sound effects and vibrations of the suit making it all feel a bit freaky. Ultimately, both of these experiences were a little gimmicky, but that's par for the course at SXSW. While I enjoyed my time gunning down zombies, though, it's hard to top Rez Infinite.

Aaron Souppouris,,2017-03-12T06:29:00-04:00,"'The Mummy' in VR was shallow, but the seats were not","VR seat company Positron teamed up with Universal at SXSW this year to showcase a ""Zero Gravity VR Experience"" tied in with the studio's The Mummy reboot. While it fell (way) short of simulating weightlessness, it was nonetheless a nice way to watch virtual reality. If only the stuff I was watching wasn't quite so shallow. Like the movie it's based on, Universal's setup at SXSW is flashy and expensive. You walk into a nondescript ballroom at a convention center, and are greeted by a section of an aircraft's fuselage, together with a life-sized ""Egyptian"" sarcophagus from the movie. Behind a blackout curtain lay 20 or so VR seats, arranged as you'd expect seating in a high-class movie theater. These seats -- Positron Voyagers -- are the real stars of the show. Positron debuted the Voyager at Sundance earlier this year, and has since been touting the seat at various VR and film shows. Resembling an Arne Jacobsen egg chair, but with none of the charm and subtlety, the Voyager contains motors to control pitch and yaw to simulate motion, a built-in Subpac for vibrations, as well as a standard Oculus Rift headset and some noise-canceling headphones. The actual VR experience was of the shallow PR-grab variety: a 10-minute featurette narrated by Tom Cruise, showing how the movie's zero-gravity action sequence (which was pretty much 90 percent of the trailer) was filmed. This featurette started with perhaps the most-impressive demonstration: You sit in a plane, it takes off. Thanks to its impressive dexterity and vibration motors, the seat effectively simulated the inertia you feel when you're ""pinned back"" on takeoff. Likewise, as the camera circled around, and the chair swiveled synchronously, it provided a real sense of place you don't get when you're sitting stationary -- it seems an effective way to reduce motion sickness by tricking your body into feeling like it's moving around. Where the demonstration fell apart was in the ""zero-gravity"" sequences. Something definitely happened -- the seat tilted back, vibrations cut out, and so on -- but in no shape or form did it replicate weightlessness. I really like the Voyager. Positron wants this chair in theaters everywhere, and it's partnered with IMAX to at least start working towards that goal. The problem now is content. It's difficult to get hyped about virtual reality, or this genuinely good chair, when watching a lifeless featurette, or honestly any of the shallow VR experiences Hollywood is tentatively churning out. VR isn't going anywhere, sure, but it's also not going to get people excited until they can watch something more interesting than a floating scientologist.

Devindra Hardawar,,2017-03-11T18:00:00-05:00,This company can track motion with sound instead of light,"When it comes to tracking physical objects in virtual spaces, pretty much every company is relying on light in some form. Oculus and HTC have their light mapping sensors, while Sony's PlayStation VR relies on infrared for its motion tracking camera. Hauoli, a young Austin-based startup demoing at SXSW, has something different in mind. It's developed a way to track virtual objects with sound. The solution is entirely software based and works with just about any speaker, so it also removes the need for expensive motion tracking hardware. But while making VR seamless is its ultimate goal, Hauoli's technology can also be used anywhere you need motion tracking. In the video demonstration above, you can see how a standard Galaxy S7 can accurately track the distance from a speaker. It can also be used to draw, but at the moment that process is encumbered with significant delays (the company blames Bluetooth for the latency). And yes, like every good motion tracking innovation, you can play Fruit Ninja with it. The company also showed off how the technology can be used to make drones follow you. And if you were wondering, yes Hauoli's accostic motion tracking also works in noisy environments. I couldn't hear much sound being emitted from the speaker in our demo, but our microphones picked up a low hum and clicking noise. The company also promises that it's energy efficient (it doesn't really take much to spit out sound), and it can deliver up to millimeter-level accuracy. It's all all very much in the early stages, but Hauoli says it currently has a patent pending for its audio technology. Lili Qiu, the company's CTO, spun off the technology from her work at the University of Texas. While it'll likely be a few years before we see Hauoli's technology in any consumer products, it's a promising glimpse of how things can evolve in the world of VR and motion tracking in general.

Total Recall Technologies sued the Facebook subsidiary in 2015 , claiming that Palmer Luckey violated a confidentiality agreement he'd signed when the company was working with him to develop a VR headset in 2010. The two parties eventually stopped communicating, and later Luckey crowdfunded development of the Oculus Rift, which TRT claimed used info covered by its agreement. Unfortunately for TRT, the Judge William Alsup of the Northern District Court in California (who you may recall from the Oracle/Google trial ) ruled that its lawsuit is invalid because one of the company's partners objected to it before stepping down.

YouTube has now collected all of them in a playlist aptly entitled ""Step Into The Games."" As you can see, they include familiar names like Minecraft , Super Mario Bros , Psychonauts , Need for Speed and Call of Duty. For maximum immersion, you'll have to access the playlist using the YouTube VR app on Google's Daydream or Cardboard headset.

If you have an Oculus Rift, though, you have a far more immersive choice: a true-to-life simulation you can visit in virtual reality. Oculus has teamed up with NASA, the European Space Agency and the Canadian Space Agency to create the Mission:ISS VR experience. You can explore the virtual station like you're actually in Low Earth Orbit (LEO), but you can do more than that, as well. So long as you're using an Oculus Touch controller, you can dock incoming spacecraft, go out on spacewalks and even perform mission-critical tasks like a real crew member. Hollywood visual effects firm Magnopus made sure the virtual ISS is as close to reality as possible by basing its design on NASA models and astronaut descriptions. It also got some help recreating the spacecraft's details from NASA Johnson Space Center's VR Laboratory. Mission:ISS is completely free and is now available from the Oculus Store. But since very few people have a Rift, Oculus has also launched a pilot program in the US that gives high school students the chance to try the experience for themselves. In addition to announcing Mission:ISS, the company has also revealed that it's sending a Rift headset to the actual space station through the French Space Agency. European astronaut Thomas Pesquet will use it to test the effects of zero G on our spatial awareness and balance. Its results will help us understand how our body could respond to future long-term missions that will take humans farther than LEO and the moon.",vr
Nick Summers,An easier way to find the best VR-friendly content on Facebook.,2017-03-08T13:00:00-05:00,Facebook's Gear VR app helps you find 360 photos and video,"A ton of 360-degree photos and videos are uploaded to Facebook every day. The challenge, if you own a Gear VR headset , is finding the best stuff in the Oculus Video store, or amongst the deluge of selfies and viral videos that make up most News Feeds. To help, the social network has built a new app for Gear VR called Facebook 360. It's a basic interface with four tabs that help you browse and launch 360-degree media. ""Explore,"" for instance, lists the most popular uploads, while ""Following"" collects everything posted by your friends, and the pages and people you follow. Facebook says more than 1 million 360-degree videos and 25 million 360-degree photos have been posted to the platform to date. Those numbers, while impressive, represent just a drop of total Facebook uploads. With its new Gear VR app, the company is trying to ensure that 360-degree content is seen by the largest possible audience. That's important, because otherwise media organisations and 'content creators' will shy away from the format. If the interest in VR tapers off, it won't have much of an impact on Facebook's popularity, or the company's overall success -- but for Oculus, and its ongoing collaboration with Samsung, it could be pivotal.",vr

Facebook and YouTube have both supported 360 videos for a while now, even letting users livestream (provided they have the right gear, of course.) It may be a little late to the party, but Vimeo is also getting into the game. While there's no livestreaming to be found yet, the platform now fully supports 360-degree video uploads and playback in a variety of ways. From a playback perspective, 360-degree playback is now integrated into the website as well as the iOS and Android apps. You can watch video in either monoscopic or stereoscopic mode -- the latter of which means you'll be able to properly view this footage while wearing a VR headset. Not all headsets are supported today, however. For starters, Vimeo's 360 video will work with Google Daydream, Samsung's Gear VR and the Zeiss VR One. But support for the Oculus Rift and HTC Vive is coming soon. Watching these videos is pretty straightforward. On the web, you can just click and drag anywhere in the video to look around; on a smartphone, you just swipe around the screen. You can also use your computer's trackpad to pan around, and there's also a helpful little compass that shows which way you're ""facing"" in the 360-degree landscape -- tapping or clicking that restores you to the default point of view, assuming the uploader enabled it. Vimeo has a reputation of being a platform designed with ""serious"" video creators in mind, and it shows in how they're rolling out 360 video controls to those uploading video. You can set exactly how wide of a field of view you want to see when the video starts and also adjust the position in 360-degree space so that viewers see what you want when the video starts up. All the same features you find when uploading standard videos are here, like detailed metadata fields and custom embed settings. Creators who want to monetize their 360-degree creations will be happy to know that Vimeo is also offering a marketplace where customers can buy their videos. Vimeo On Demand lets uploaders in the ""pro"" and ""business"" tiers set whatever price and terms they want for their videos, including full purchase, rental, and subscription options. Additionally, Vimeo will offer a 360-degree video school to help shooters find best practices for using the new format. And if you just want to find video to watch, the platform will be curating and sharing its favorite clips in a dedicated channel.

Edgar Alvarez,'Pokemon Go' was just the beginning.,2017-03-07T09:30:00-05:00,Tech companies and game devs are gearing up for AR,"Last year's Game Developers Conference was ruled by virtual reality. From Sony detailing its PSVR launch plans to Oculus showcasing the first batch of games for the consumer Rift headset, you couldn't swing a Meowth at the event without hitting a VR booth. But perhaps fueled by the success of Pokémon Go in 2016, augmented reality has become the new industry darling. That's not to say VR has been kicked to the curb completely, but at GDC 2017 we saw the emergence of AR as a compelling technology for gaming and beyond. Take Epic Games, the maker of game-development platform Unreal Engine: It showed the potential of high-end augmented reality with ""Project Raven."" The company has created a tool that lets content creators, like filmmakers, merge visual effects with live-action shots. Epic Games said at its GDC 2017 keynote that in TV or movie shoots, a single computer-generated frame typically takes an hour to render and days of editing before it can resemble a photoreal image. With Project Raven, which will be coming to Unreal Engine later this year, a director of photography can essentially get a live preview of what a CGI scene will look like. For Hollywood, this could be a game changer. Epic Games has also partnered with Chevrolet to create an experience for Google Tango that gives users a 360-degree view of a Camaro ZL1. The software uses 3D depth-sensing features from a compatible device, such as Lenovo's Phab 2 Pro , to show different angles of the car as you configure it to your liking in real time. Right now it only works when you change the ZL1's color, but there may be options to tinker with the rims, headlights and other parts later on. Epic says the idea is to give you a more immersive view of your dream car rather than imagine it by looking at mockups from still images. Meanwhile, Microsoft announced at GDC 2017 its plans to bring mixed reality to the Xbox in 2018. That's going to be huge for consumers, particularly those who own one of the company's latest consoles. Even though Microsoft prefers to refer to its efforts in the space as mixed reality, not augmented, they're basically the same thing. The goal with AR and MR, unlike with VR, is to blend digital objects with environments from the real world. Up until now Microsoft's been showing the capabilities of mixed reality through HoloLens , but that's a $3,000 device that not every consumer (or even some developers) can afford. That's where Acer's Mixed Reality headset , revealed last week, comes in. While the price remains unknown, it's expected to cost much less than Hololens. Microsoft says this will give more developers a chance to build mixed reality experiences for Windows devices, including its PCs and Xbox -- which could be an alternative to Sony's PSVR. The tech giant was coy about its strategy for mixed reality and consoles, but we'll likely learn more about that at its Build conference or at E3, happening in May and June, respectively. In case the augmented reality boom wasn't clear enough, Pokémon Go capped it all off by winning Best Mobile/Handheld Game at the GDC awards. The title from Niantic edged out Nintendo's Super Mario Run for the top honor in the category, showing how important the AR game was to the industry. As for why augmented reality could be more compelling than virtual reality, it may come down to a couple of factors: motion sickness and hardware setup. ""For a very significant portion of the population, it doesn't take very long for you to feel nauseated using it [VR],"" said an executive for a major technology company involved in the AR space who asked to remain anonymous. The exec went on to say that one of the main problems with VR headsets, at least high-end ones like the Oculus Rift and HTC Vive , is the amount of work that goes into setting them up before you can use them. ""The primary reason that these devices will get returned is people gave up when they were trying to set them up,"" the executive said. "" The positional-tracking , drilling holes in your walls or getting the beacon, it's way harder than it seems like it should be."" There's no doubt that augmented and virtual reality can coexist, and it's up to consumers to use the medium best suited for their needs. We know what developers can do for gaming with both and how fun it can be. But there are areas where AR has the potential to be more useful than VR, including medicine and education, where you need to have some sort of real-world interaction to make the most out of the technology.

NVIDIA is going to release a new tool called the FCAT VR that will take some of the guesswork out of system testing. It tracks four key metrics that can lead to high latency, stuttering and other issues: frame time, dropped frames, warp misses and synthesized frames. Frame time, the amount of time it takes to render a frame, is the crucial gauge. ""The lower the time, the more likely it is that the app will maintain a frame rate of 90 frames per second needed for a quality VR experience,"" NVIDIA writes. Dropped frames and warp misses can cause stuttering and other annoying problems, while synthesized frames, rather than true rendered frames, indicate that the system is struggling with the game's demands. The tool is not unlike NVIDIA's original FCAT tool for desktop displays, but adapted to the extra demands of VR. As such, it'll let virtual reality developers quantify performance with detailed data and charters, rather than just putting on a headset and seeing how it feels. It'll also let you test your own system to see if you need better hardware or just some tweaks to the setup you have.",vr
Edgar Alvarez,,2017-03-02T19:52:00-05:00,'#Archery' is a quirky VR party game for the HTC Vive,"I wasn't expecting to start my day using a bow and arrow to shoot ice cream cones at kids, or riding on the back of a pickup truck slinging newspapers in a suburban neighborhood. But thanks to #Archery , a virtual reality game from indie studio VRUnicorns , I was able to do just that using an HTC Vive headset. The title, which hits Steam Early Access on March 30th for $10, features a handful of main levels and mini games within each one of those. My experience consisted of scenarios like what I mentioned above, where I took charge of a digital bow and arrow to fire different objects at characters around the environment. You can control the weapon with the Vive's motion controllers , naturally, and the experience was so fun that the developers basically had to kick me out of their demo booth. After playing for around 20 minutes, my arms and shoulders actually felt sore from all the archery movements and gestures I was making, though that may be more telling of my out-of-shape body than anything related to the game itself. Still, it felt like a good, quick workout and I enjoyed every second of it, even if my bow and arrow shooting accuracy was nothing short of appalling. While #Archery will only be available on the HTC Vive at first, the developers say the game could come to other VR platforms in the future. And let's hope so, because everyone deserves a chance to pretend like they're shooting ice cream cones at kids and turning them into unicorn creatures, which only happens if you hit them before they can destroy your creamery stand.

Sean Buckley,,2017-03-02T13:33:00-05:00,Survios' 'Sprint Vector' lets you run in VR without getting sick,"Locomotion and speed are two of the hardest problems to solve in virtual reality -- get either one wrong, and players are going to get sick. That's why so many VR experiences use teleportation as their primary movement mechanic. It's a safe, slow way to let players explore large game worlds. It's become a bit of a standard, but you won't find it anywhere in Survios' next title. Sprint Vector is a fast-paced racing game that lets players sprint through obstacle courses at superhuman speeds. The game balks at the idea of the safe, slow VR environment, but somehow avoids inflicting simulator sickness on the player. The key: making hands the new feet. Hand-based locomotion is nothing new in virtual reality, but it's not usually an analog for walking or running. In Lone Echo , players use their feet to explore a weightless environment. In The Climb , one scales a mountain. These applications of arm movement feel natural because they're identical to what one would physically do in those situations. Sprint Vector's movement system isn't, but somehow it still works. To run, players extend an arm forward, hold down the trigger and pull back for the length of the stride before letting go. They alternate arms back and forth to accelerate through a neon race course at breakneck speeds. Everything I know about VR tells me this shouldn't work, but when I tried an early build of the game at GDC 2017, it did. Gliding through corridors, vaulting over walls and gliding through the air all felt almost natural. When I strafed in the opposite direction I was looking, I felt a little bit dizzy, but never at all sick. Yet I know from experience that if I had performed the same actions at the same in-game speed using a thumbstick, I would have been extremely uncomfortable. I asked Survios about it, and was told that momentum plays a large role here. Accelerating with a joystick would be too instant, but if the player uses his arms, he's pushing himself and gaining speed with each push. Once he gets up to high speed, he's eased into the experience and created enough forward momentum to keep the movement headed largely in one direction, without any sharp turns or inversions to upturn the stomach. In a way, it feels like cross-country skiing more than running, but it's a movement system that works. Still, it might be the most dangerous standing VR experience I've ever played -- not because I feel like i'm going to get sick or fall down but because the movement system largely amounts to frantically flailing your arms in multiple directions. In the state the game is now, I'd be afraid to play it in my house for fear of hitting my wife or punching a bookshelf. The game is just so fast-paced that it's easy to lose track of how much you've drifted in the real world from your starting point. If players have enough space when the final game comes out, though, the risk might be worth it. Not only is Sprint Vector extremely fun, but it's a fresh VR experience. One that breaks free from the crutch of teleportation. Its movement engine won't work for every genre, but it's a great experiment in finding better ways to move around in virtual worlds without actually moving around. Unfortunately, there's no word when the game will be available to consumers. Right now, it's just an early prototype -- but it shows a lot of promise.

Nicole Lee,The flip-up design is pretty cool.,2017-03-02T08:00:00-05:00,LG's SteamVR headset is a bulky yet promising HTC Vive alternative,"For the past year, the only two contenders in the PC virtual-reality space were the Oculus Rift and the HTC Vive. Not anymore. A few days ago, LG announced its own PC-driven VR headset , which was made in collaboration with Valve. That means that there are now two headsets -- the Vive and the LG -- that make use of Valve's SteamVR tracking technology. I took a closer look at a prototype of the LG headset here at GDC 2017, and though it could certainly use some improvement, it has a lot of potential. LG's SteamVR headset is not a small device by any stretch of the imagination. From some angles, it actually looks more like a helmet than a headset. Its design is not unlike the PSVR , with an all-plastic build that encompasses everything from the eyepiece to the headband that holds it in place. There's a nice smooth surface on the front of the goggles -- a stark contrast to the HTC Vive's pockmarked face. But if you hold the LG headset to the light, you're able to see the various sensors beneath the smooth veneer. Also on the front is a camera lens, which LG says would be used for pass-through view eventually. You put on the LG headset by wearing it as if it were a backwards baseball cap, with the rear band wrapping around the back of the head and the front piece pointing upward. You can then tighten it around your head by ratcheting the sides in, and by adjusting a scroll wheel on the back. It all feels comfy and snug, like it's giving your skull a bear hug. It did loosen a little bit during gameplay, however, which could be due to the headset's considerable heft shifting slightly as you move around. LG's Steam #VR headset #gdc #gdc17 #gdc2017 #virtualreality A post shared by Engadget (@engadget) on Mar 1, 2017 at 3:47pm PST One design detail I particularly appreciate is that you can extend the eyepiece, flip it up and then bring it back down over your eyes again without much effort. This makes jumping in and out of virtual reality that much easier, which could be useful if you have kids and pets running around, or if you just need a quick sip of water in between killing alien invaders. The wand controllers look similar to the Vive's, but with ends that are angular and blocky instead of circular. They also feel nicer, thanks to a textured grip on the sides that make them easier to hold. It's also similar to the Vive in that the LG headset uses the same Lighthouse tracking tech Valve developed -- LG even made its own base stations. Seeing that both headsets were made to Valve's specifications, the similarities aren't too surprising. According to LG, the headset has a 3.64-inch display with a 1,440 x 1,280 resolution for each lens, a refresh rate of 90Hz, plus a 110-degree field of view. Right now, the IPD can't be adjusted, there are no built-in headphones and, as we said, it's a little heavy. But it's only a prototype; LG has said it's open to changing the design as it receives more user feedback. I tried the LG SteamVR headset for only about 15 minutes, but I was suitably impressed. I batted an electric racquetball around, played a longbow minigame and watched an abstract ballerina twirl its way around me. The display quality is great, and the screen-door effect (visible pixels) was minimal enough that after a while I forgot it was there. The reaction times from me flailing around the controllers were on point as well. On the whole, it made a pretty notable first impression. The design is impressive for a prototype, and the performance is good, too. A lot could change between now and when it comes to market, of course, so we'll have to wait and see if the final LG headset can take on the competition. Unfortunately, that might take a while: LG won't say how much it costs or when it's expected to ship. Click here to catch up on the latest news from GDC 2017!",vr
Nicole Lee,"The company also showed off the Acer Windows Mixed Reality headset, which ships to developers later this month.",2017-03-01T14:32:00-05:00,Microsoft plans to bring mixed reality to the Xbox in 2018,"Last year, Microsoft revealed it would open up its Windows Holographic Platform to other hardware manufacturers , and at CES, we got a sneak peek at a few different Windows VR headsets. At GDC this week, Microsoft revealed yet more plans for its mixed-reality platform. While its headsets are strictly for the PC right now, they will soon be coming to the Xbox -- as well as Microsoft's Project Scorpio console -- in 2018. It's still unclear what this will actually look like. Will there be an Xbox VR headset? That seems to be the implication. ""We're also excited to share that Windows Mixed Reality experiences will light up on other devices over time, beyond desktop and Microsoft HoloLens,"" said the company in a statement. ""Our plan is to bring mixed-reality content to the Xbox One family of devices, including Project Scorpio, in 2018."" Also at GDC, Microsoft showed off a developer edition of the Acer Windows ""Mixed Reality"" headset -- that's the new term for what used to be Windows Holographic -- which ships to a few select developers later this month. (That's the headset in the image above.) It has two high-resolution displays at 1440 x 1440, a display-refresh rate of up to 90 hertz, a 3.5mm jack for built-in audio support plus HDMI 2.0 and USB 3.0 ports for connecting to a computer. Like all of Microsoft's mixed-reality hardware, it also has inside-out tracking, which lets you have positional tracking without the need for external sensors. As for when consumers will be able to get one, shipments begin sometime this holiday season, which is also when headsets from ASUS, Dell and Lenovo are likely to make their debut. We'll probably learn more details about Microsoft's mixed-reality future at its Build conference in May and at E3 in June. Click here to catch up on the latest news from GDC 2017!",vr

Sean Buckley,This VR game allows you decide how much motion is too much.,2017-02-28T10:00:00-05:00,'From Other Suns' lets players move in VR however they want,"When I boot up a new VR game for the first time, the same question always hangs in my mind. ""So,"" I think, ""how do you teleport in this game?"" It's become a standard in virtual reality , the go-to movement system that lets players explore the digital realm without contracting simulator sickness. It works, but not perfectly. Warping from place to place avoids the disparity between vision and physical movement that causes nausea, but teleporting across a tiny walkable distance feels a little weird. From Other Suns doesn't change the basic function of the teleport mechanic but adds a nice twist: It lets you see your character actually walk to the teleport location. Believe it or not, this makes a big difference. For the most part, From Other Suns is a first-person experience -- but when the player moves, her character model runs out of the player's view, pulling the game into a third-person perspective. Instead of ""teleporting,"" this lets the player navigate spaces as one might play a fixed-camera adventure game. This is slower than instant teleportation, but it feels more connected to the game environment. As a player, you're not warping around a virtual world--you're walking through it, albeit in third-person. Feeling connected to the world matters, too. From Other Suns is a huge, open-universe space adventure game with countless procedurally generated environments to explore. Moving around that universe needs to feel natural. The game's version of teleportation is too slow for the first-person combat sections of the game. It's hard to strafe and dodge enemy fire with the game's slow walking animation, a situation worsened by the fact the view changes to third-person whenever you try to walk anywhere -- making shooting while moving impossible. Fortunately, this restriction applies only to the game's default ""comfort mode."" Turning it off puts the player in first-person mode exclusively, allowing her to move while shooting, avoid attacks and more quickly navigate the game's environments. Offering two movement styles seems reasonable and straightforward, but it's actually a huge departure from how most VR games are designed. Allowing players to move their in-game characters without moving their body risks creating a discrepancy between what the eye sees and what the body feels -- a classic recipe for simulator sickness. It's not an experience all players can handle, but by making it an option players have to search for, From Other Suns allows advanced players to decide for themselves if they can handle a more-extreme VR experience. Even if it's not normal, it's refreshing; it's all well and good to cater to the most comfortable travel mechanic , but it's nice to have the option for a more immersive experience if you know you can handle it.

Stefanie Fogel,LG is the first company besides HTC to use Valve's SteamVR tracking technology.,2017-02-27T14:45:00-05:00,LG is working on a VR headset with Valve,"LG is teaming up with video game developer Valve to create a head-mounted virtual reality device that uses SteamVR tracking technology. This places LG in direct competition with HTC, which teamed up with Valve to create the HTC Vive. This is not the first time LG has dipped its toes into the VR pool. Last year, it released the (largely forgettable) 360 VR headset for the G5 smartphone. LG hasn't released many details about its new prototype, simply calling it a ""high fidelity, next generation VR experience."" But we do know the headset will use Valve's royalty-free SteamVR 3D tracking system. Valve began offering open access to SteamVR tracking last year, but LG is the first company besides HTC to utilize it. LG will show off its new headset in Valve's booth at this year's GDC in San Francisco, where it says it will meet with developers to collect feedback and impressions. Engadget has a team of reporters at GDC — hopefully we'll get to see the headset up close before the show is over.

Cherlynn Low,,2017-02-27T09:52:00-05:00,K-pop and VR at MWC is sensory overload,"I expected MWC to be a roller-coaster ride of emotions, but I wasn't quite anticipating getting on a literal one (albeit in VR) here at the show. When Korea Telecom (KT) offered up a chance to party with K-pop band Twice, I just had to get in line despite not really knowing what awaited me. VR experiences are pretty played out at this point, but Korea Telecom adds a twist by promising to deliver the media over 5G, which it just announced it will deploy commercially by 2019. Of course, since 5G isn't actually a thing yet , we were wired into a computer, and this demo really only showcased KT's ability to create entertaining VR content with a simulator ride. The whole thing looked relatively harmless at first. I climbed into a chair in the middle of what looks like a giant hamster wheel, and KT reps strapped me in with a seatbelt and a roller-coaster-style overhead harness. That should have been my first clue. When I put on the headset, I saw myself sitting in an airplane holding a up a phone playing a Twice music video. Then a flight attendant beckoned me and I followed her towards the plane door (for some unknown reason), which opened to reveal we were up in the clouds. And that's when the madness began, and I descended into a psychedelic, often-terrifying journey that was basically a trippy K-pop music video showcasing Seoul's hotspots. As I slid up and down simulated environments from ski slopes to roller-coaster tracks, the chair I was in spun within the hamster wheel in tandem with what I was seeing while fans blew wind in my face. It was a well-executed experience that had me in tears of overstimulation by the end. For now, the people and scenes in the video are rendered in cartoonish 3D, but a KT rep tells Engadget that the goal is to eventually use actual photographic images. If KT is able to stream such a graphics-intensive clip over 5G by 2017, it'll be an impressive feat. But the question then is: Do people really need to be riding faux roller-coasters outside of their homes (or anywhere they'll use 5G instead of WiFi, anyway)?

Steve Dent,The Tracker goes on sale March 27th while Strap pre-orders start May 2nd.,2017-02-27T07:00:00-05:00,HTC's Vive Tracker and Deluxe Audio Strap cost $100 each,"HTC launched a pair of desirable accessories for its Vive VR headset at CES 2017 in Las Vegas last month, and now we know when they'll arrive and for how much. The Vive Tracker , a 3D tracking device that you can attach to your wrists or any objects you want to use in VR, will cost $100 (£100 in the UK) and arrive to developers only starting on March 27th. The Deluxe Audio Strap , which adds some much-needed comfort to the otherwise fabulous headset, will also cost $100 and £100 in the UK. These new accessories are pretty important for HTC's fledgling Vive division. While the Vive has reportedly logged decent sales, possibly better than Oculus, Sony recently revealed that it has sold nearly a million Playstation VR headsets, likely more than HTC and Oculus put together. The main knock on the Vive headset (besides the whopping $800 price) is the lack of comfort. The Deluxe Audio Strap goes a long way to solving that issue thanks to its adjustable sizing dial, and it has built-in headphones to boot. It might irk some buyers to pay an extra $100 for the strap when they've already shelled out $800, though. As for the Tracker (above), you can attach it to your legs and arms, making jumping, punching, ducking and crouching actions more realistic in fighting games. ""You can now comfortably kick objects, see yourself crouching, and even lie prone with one-to-one accuracy in Island 359 ,"" developer Steve Bowler told HTC. It can also be added to a dummy gun-type device, making simulated in-game weapons work like the real ones. During CES, HTC also fixed one to a fire hose as part of a firefighter training game, showing the potential of the device for military, police and other types of simulations. The Tracker goes on sale on March 27th for $100, but only for developers and with a vague ""later in the year"" timeline for end-users. That means it'll take a while for the product to get into consumers' hands, as companies must first integrate the device into their games and software. HTC said, however, that the tracker ""is a key piece"" of its Vive ecosystem and VR strategy, not just for gaming but areas like education, training and health and wellness.",vr
Jon Fingas,It's likely the most popular VR hardware to date.,2017-02-26T17:47:00-05:00,Sony has sold nearly 1 million PlayStation VR headsets,"Ever since PlayStation VR , speculation has been rampant: is console-based virtual reality here to stay, or will it die an early death? Apparently, its near-term future is secure. Sony's Andrew House tells the New York Times that the company had sold 915,000 PSVR headsets as of February 19th, just over four months after its October 13th debut. That doesn't sound like much for a company that has sold tens of millions of PlayStation 4s , but it's well ahead of expectations -- Sony had hoped to reach the 1 million mark by mid-April. Sales might have been better still if the company hadn't been purposefully cautious with production, leading to shortages centered primarily in its home turf of Japan. Play time in VR is also going up, House adds. While many PSVR experiences are short, Resident Evil 7 's support for VR throughout the entire game has doubled the average play length. In other words, it's a technology that may be hitting its stride as developers learn to craft more than tech demos and mini games. It's not certain how well that stands in comparison to PC-based VR headsets. However, SuperData Research estimates that there were 243,000 Oculus Rift units sold through the end of 2016, and 420,000 HTC Vive units. If the real figures are reasonably close, that makes Sony the leading VR maker on the planet despite having a smaller amount of time to build its user base. A sales victory wouldn't exactly be surprising. PSVR requires a much smaller investment than its rivals -- even if you splurge on a PS4 Pro and a full VR bundle , you're spending far less than it takes to get a high-end PC VR headset and a computer powerful enough to handle it. And that's not including the physical space you need for room-scale VR experiences with PCs. Combine that with a healthy game library and console VR is likely to remain the front-runner for a while, at least until prices for headsets and VR-worthy PCs drop to the point where they're no longer luxuries.",vr

Adding motion input (as well as a few more buttons) lets you navigate and interact with VR content without having to paw at the headset's buttons like with previous iterations. In addition to a clickable touchpad, there are trigger, home, back and volume keys. The controller also has an accelerometer, gyrometer and magnetic sensors built in. The new hardware will work with the Galaxy S7, S7 Edge, and Note 5, as well as the Galaxy S6 series. The controller, which looks nothing like Oculus' own Touch peripherals , also comes with a wrist strap, offering a Wii-esque form of safety against flying controllers. The new Gear VR headset packs in 42mm lenses with a 101-degree field of view and improved distortion correction tech to further reduce motion sickness. And if you don't need the controller, there's a strap built into the headset to house it. The controller itself doesn't need charging; you just need to replace a AAA battery inside. A company spokesperson says that more than 70 new controller titles are already in development, and existing touchpad apps will also work with the remote. We'll be looking to strap on the new version as soon as we can, and see how it compares to Google's Daydream View , which also includes a controller. Expect to hear more from us soon!

Jon Fingas,Steam Audio reflects the actual shape of the game world.,2017-02-25T22:33:00-05:00,Valve promises more realistic audio for VR,"Most of the effort in improving virtual reality focuses on the visuals. But what about audio -- isn't it jarring to hear sound that clearly doesn't mirror the world you're in? Valve thinks it can fix that. It just released a Steam Audio kit that lets developers provide more immersive sound in games and apps, particularly for VR. On top of producing binaural audio (reflecting how your body affects listening), it has a particularly advanced, physics-based approach to generating sound effects. For one, Steam Audio can handle situations where obstacles only block some of the sound. If you're rounding a corner, you'll hear a subtler transition from muffled to clear noises. It can also propagate sound around objects in real time, rather than relying on clunky custom effects. And reverb depends on not just the shape of the environment, but the acoustic properties of its materials. A metal hallway in a spaceship is much more likely to reverberate sounds than a carpeted room in a house, for instance. The kit is freely available and currently works with Android, Linux, Mac and Windows devices using the Unity engine. Unreal Engine 4 support is coming soon. It's up to creators to take Valve up on its offer and implement Steam Audio, but the technology could easily provide an important boost to VR, and games as a whole. Developers won't have to bend over backwards to create realistic audio environments, particularly for room-sized VR where crawling under a desk or leaning around a corner can make a big difference in what you hear.",vr
Sean Buckley,Nothing makes a rough ride worse than bad VR.,2017-02-25T15:00:00-05:00,Six Flags' new VR roller coaster is both breathtaking and broken,"Imagine screaming through deep space, swerving through the wreckage of exploding starships in a high-octane scene plucked straight out of a science fiction movie. Suddenly the universe stops, frozen in time as your body continues to hurl through the void at high speed. Your stomach churns at the realization that it's moving but, somehow, the world around you isn't. That's what happened to me this weekend on Six Flags' Galactic Attack -- a virtual reality roller coaster, available at Six Flags' two California parks, that broke halfway through my ride. Twice. This wasn't the experience I was expecting. After all, Galactic Attack isn't Six Flags' first virtual reality roller coaster. Between the park's experience and my personal love of VR, I was looking forward to a smooth ride. My optimism disintegrated when my VR headset froze during one of the ride's first twists. Twice, the view in my Gear VR headset halted for more than a second, leaping forward to ""catch up"" with the speeding ride vehicle and creating a gap between what my eyes were seeing and the g-forces my body was experiencing. It was nauseating. If everything had gone as intended, I probably would have come away thrilled by a high-speed VR space combat experience that perfectly synced with the roller coaster's track. Instead, I was fighting a headache brought on by simulator sickness. This isn't the typical riding experience, but it's not unprecedented. Park officials told me that most guests are treated to a smooth virtual reality adventure, but certain seats on the ride vehicle have a higher chance of losing synchronization with the track. It's a Bluetooth problem. Each headset connects to a black box mounted above the seats near the center of the car. On straightaways and loops, this hub can easily reach every rider's Gear VR headset , but sometimes, tight twists and inversions can briefly put the roller coaster's steel track between a specific user and the black box, breaking the Bluetooth connection just long enough to stall the simulation. Six Flags' representative told me it was enough of a problem that one of the park's earlier VR roller coasters barred users from using Gear VR headsets in the front row, and the transmitter has since been moved to a location that minimizes the issue. Minimizes, yes, but doesn't eliminate. Perhaps I'm being too harsh. When the virtual reality space battle wasn't frozen, it was breathtaking. It started off by showing me the real world through the Gear VR's passthrough camera before drawing the roller coaster through an augmented reality wormhole to deep space. There, I was more than a passenger; I was a participant, playing a fast-paced action game that tasked me with shooting down alien fighter pilots while being rocketed through the chaos of a massive space battle. I walked away intrigued by the experience, but I was still nauseated. Enough so that every time I thought about riding Galactic Attack again, I felt sick. If you ride Six Flags Discovery Kingdom's Galactic Attack VR roller coaster, you probably won't have the broken, frozen VR experience I endured. Park staff told me it happens only on a few seats at the front of the car, and even then, only rarely. Six Flags maintenance supervisor Charles Laureano claims that most riders don't get sick at all. ""The New Revolution Galactic Attack roller coaster is synched precisely with the coaster's drops, twists and turns,"" he said in a statement. ""Because of this, riders are not affected by motion sickness as some might expect when on a VR coaster."" Indeed, park staff told me that sitting in the middle and rear seats will offer a more consistent experience, but a potentially nauseating ride shouldn't even be an option -- not even if the chances of failure are low. Theme parks have always been centers of innovation, and virtual reality has the potential to be the next big revolution in ride technology -- but harnessing that potential means accepting responsibility for it. Right now, Six Flags has a VR roller coaster system that sees failure as inevitable. The fact that my broken, stomach-churning VR experience was a known but acceptable issue is, frankly, unacceptable. I'm lucky to have a high-end VR headset at home, but many people will experience virtual reality for the first time on a roller coaster. They deserve to have that first foray into a digital realm be safe, exhilarating and free from avoidable simulator sickness. Update 2/27/2017 : After investigating the incident further, Six Flags contacted us to explain that a weak Bluetooth signal probably what wasn't froze my VR headset. The real culprit, it turns out, were missing files on the Gear VR headset. Thomas Wagner, CEO and co-founder of VR Coaster, says the space battle's animation sequence is composed of 15GB of images, which should have continued in sequence even if the headset lost synchronization with the black box. Apparently, some of those files were lost when the VR experience was transferred to the device I wore. ""We found that it was just an incomplete installation on the headset,"" he told me after some investigation, ""not a general issue with the ride."" He says it's the kind of problem that can sometimes slip through in the first days of ride operation, but reports like mine help them get fixed. Wagner tells me that Six Flags is now checking the installation on every device at the park to make sure they have complete installations. ""Six Flags really does have high quality requirements,"" he explained. ""They would have never knowingly accepted such a possibility for an image freeze."" He said the key to figuring this out was how long the freeze was -- a weak Bluetooth signal would have caused a stutter at best, but a long hang of up to a second indicated a bigger problem. ""When parts of the image sequence are missing, you will encounter exactly such a freeze.""",vr
Edgar Alvarez,,2017-02-24T11:10:00-05:00,The NBA hopes VR will expand its audience,"This year's NBA All-Star Weekend wasn't just about the iconic Slam Dunk Contest or the riveting game between the best players from the Eastern and Western conferences. Yes, these were certainly the main attractions for attendees and viewers at home, but the event was also an opportunity for the NBA to showcase the ways in which technology will play a role in the future of the game. That future includes wearables, eSports and virtual reality, a medium whose immersive format the league says will help it reach wider audiences. Last week, the NBA announced it had made its first original content for virtual reality headsets through a partnership with the Hollywood digital production company Digital Domain. The NBA VR app, available exclusively for Google Daydream , features on-demand episodes of a talk show called House of Legends , where former NBA players discuss moments from their careers as well as various pop culture topics. There are also 360-degree video tours of team arenas, player interviews and highlights. This is notable because until the launch of NBA VR, the league had only focused on making live games with NextVR, a company that develops broadcast tech for virtual reality events. Although the NBA did introduce a VR documentary titled Follow my Lead: The Story of the 2016 NBA Finals last year, the experience was created by Oculus, not the league itself. In the documentary, viewers got an immersive look at the championship series between the Cleveland Cavaliers and Golden State Warriors, narrated by actor Michael B. Jordan ( Creed , Fruitvale Station , Friday Night Lights ). The NBA's push into the VR's live space kicked into high gear in 2015, when it streamed its first game of the season in 360-degree video. Today, the league is now livestreaming one game every week to Gear VR and Google Daydream via NextVR's application. At first, the main caveat for fans was that to access the content they needed an NBA League Pass account, which isn't exactly feasible since the service costs $200 per season. That said, the NBA recently added an à la carte option that lets users pay $7 per game if they want to watch it on their VR headset. Neither the NBA nor NextVR was willing to disclose viewership numbers to Engadget; they only said they've received ""tremendous positive"" feedback from people tuning in to these 360-degree video streams. The benefit to watching this way over a traditional TV broadcast, the two companies say, is that it allows fans who may not be able to attend the arena to feel like they're actually there. Jeff Marsilio, NBA VP of global media distribution, said being able to offer games in VR is particularly valuable for fans who don't live in the US or can't afford a front-row ticket. ""That's why the courtside seat is such an iconic seat in all of entertainment,"" Marsilio said. ""With virtual reality, you can actually deliver something like that experience. You can make people feel closer to the action."" He claims there's not any other medium that delivers on this kind of promise, but he cautions that it's too early to tell if this will be successful for the NBA in the long run. The challenge, he said, is making sure fans are actually enjoying the content and that it doesn't take away from simply enjoying the game. As far as production goes, the setup isn't much different from a TV broadcast. For a typical game, NextVR has seven to eight cameras around the NBA arena. They're placed on the scorer's table, behind the baskets, in the locker room hallways and floating mid-court. Through it all, there's a producer choosing the best camera angles and cutting graphics that display stats, game clock, shot clock and other information you'd expect to see as you're watching an NBA game. Naturally, you also have announcers narrating the event. Their main goal is to guide you along the way and ensure that your head isn't all over the place in the virtual arena. At the same time, though, NextVR wants you to have that freedom to explore whenever you want; that's what makes this different than the 2D viewing experience you get from TV. Mark Rogondino , a sports broadcaster who now does games for NextVR's NBA games, said the key part is knowing everyone is different; some people may want to keep their eyes on the ball whereas others may be more interested in what's happening on the team benches. When asked if watching in VR could end up distracting people from the game, Rogondino said he believes it's more like peeling another layer for the viewer. ""Did people feel it was distracting when the game, or whatever they were watching, went from black and white to color?"" he asked. ""All of a sudden they were like, 'Oh my gosh, those flowers in the corner are so much more vivid than I ever thought they were.' Then eventually, over time, you adjust to watching that and if you ever went to black and white you would think, 'Oh my God. This is archaic.'"" There are some downsides to the tech, though. For one, don't expect to watch games in high resolution with a VR headset, though that could change later on as VR production cameras improve. The other thing is, can your brain really handle a two-hour basketball game in 360-degree video? Everyone's different, but personally I would prefer sitting on my couch and watching an NBA game on my big-screen TV. That's not to say I don't understand the benefits of the medium, such as making me feel as if I'm sitting courtside. It's definitely a more immersive experience than what I can get from a TV. In an interview during All-Star Weekend 2017, two-time NBA MVP Stephen Curry , of the Golden State Warriors, told Engadget that he hopes the league continues to experiment with VR and other tech like it. ""From a fan standpoint, anytime you have technological advancements like that, where you can just create a more immersive experience for the game, "" he said. ""I think that's special."" Curry said he's tried a number of undisclosed virtual reality projects and is always amazed at how he can step into ""a whole new world."" When it comes to experimenting with VR, the NBA is a step ahead of fellow major sports leagues like the NFL, MLB and MLS. But, if the medium starts to prove its worth among fans, don't be surprised to see more of them follow in the NBA's footsteps and start livestreaming their games to VR headsets all over the world. In fact, the NFL announced its first 360-degree video series for Daydream and YouTube a couple of months ago, so chances are it won't be long before you can catch a Sunday night football game on some VR platform. Marsilio said the NBA plans to keep learning as it goes and, most importantly, listen to feedback from fans on what works and what doesn't. ""I think we've got a ways to go before we really, truly fulfill [VR's] potential,"" he said. ""And as the technology improves we want to make sure we're improving with it, so that when it's fully materialized and mature, we're ready.""",vr

Its leaves match the crimson landscape that stretches out before me. In the distance, a rusty orange forest fades into the background. There's a gentle rustling of leaves, occasionally interrupted by the faint chirping of a bird, that forces me to breathe slower. ""Thank you for being here and being willing to consider moving towards the idea of dying and death,"" a calm, male voice prepares me for the virtual meditative journey. A hazy white light source rises in the distance as the voice walks me through the process of focusing on my breathing. I watch the blades of the grass swish to the left with the wind. The tree slowly starts to lose its leaves. ""Feel the air around you,"" the voice continues. ""Feel yourself letting go as if you're a tree dropping your leaves. The breeze takes the leaves away. Everything that you know and everything you cherish will be taken by the wind."" As I let the weight of those words sink in, the blue sky slowly takes on a deep green hue, ushering in darker skies. Within moments, the field beneath me turns into a deep red lake that starts to rise around me. I gasp for air before I quickly remind myself that I have an Oculus Rift headset on my face. When We Die is a virtual reality experience for perhaps the most difficult kind of contemplation: the end of life. The first half, with the metaphorical tree, presents the ephemerality of nature as a symbol of the finiteness of your own life. But the next chapter addresses the wider perception of death as a tragedy through real-life experiences. In the second half, serene views of the cosmos shift the narrative from considering your own mortality to thinking about the process of dying as an inescapable reality for all. Celestial objects that dot the night sky reveal audio clips from a hospice worker, who shares her observations of death, and a neurologist, who grounds the experience in a physician's approach to it. ""We wanted to create a safe space for people to have difficult conversations,"" said Paula Ceballos, an NYU student who is a part of a trio that created When We Die for the school's Interactive Telecommunications Program. ""We find that in the Western culture death and dying and aging get put behind closed doors, and we wanted to bring it up and make you think about it."" The fear of death, your own or a loved one's, is deeply ingrained in the human psyche. It can drive the choices we make , yet it continues to be shrouded in mystery. Over the years, hundreds of research studies have probed the process of dying, the fear of confronting death and how the awareness of one's own mortality has impacted religious, cultural and spiritual world views. When We Die makes room for that spiritual contemplation with its abstract worlds: There are no physical bodies, only metaphors for the process of aging and dying. But the idea is rooted in a more practical understanding of the ways in which neglecting end-of-life processes can hamper the process of dying, especially for the elderly and the terminally ill. Your browser does not support the audio element ""It leads to systemic challenges,"" said Leslie Ruckman, an NYU student whose background in health care informed her work on When We Die. ""There's all this money that gets spent on treating patients in ICUs, and people [often] end up dying in hospitals even though advance directives might say they'd rather die at home. These are bigger issues that arise out of the inability to look at the end of life and not being able to define what a good death might look like."" The VR experience relies on surreal visuals to make that happen. According to co-creator Dana Abrassart, when the group first started working on the project, they envisioned a James Turrell-style liminal space. But they quickly realized that a virtual take on the light and space movement would trigger motion sickness. Nausea in a death-related experience would defeat the purpose of their work. So instead, the group found inspiration in Richard Mosse's infrared imagery. ""It's this idea that there's a light spectrum around us but the human eye can't see it,"" Ruckman told me. ""We liked that as a parallel to this natural process that is always present and yet, we choose not to see it."" Death is a constant. Yet its prevalence is hidden behind hospital doors. ""In the US, there's a sanitization of death,"" Dr. Gayatri Devi, the neurologist whose voice floats through the cosmos in the second half of the VR experience, told me at her clinic in Manhattan. ""Our current view of death might be a victim of industrialization and development. There's less contact with ill people who are dying so they get sequestered and put in a different place. Whereas in India, for example, there is a philosophy of maintaining contact with family and contact with death is not uncommon."" More than 80 percent of Americans with chronic illnesses would prefer to forego hospitalization, but according to the CDC , 70 percent of that population dies in a hospital or nursing home. Even in cases where patients have advance directives to avoid aggressive measures, a widespread study revealed that only 25 percent of the physicians were aware of their patients' end-of-life choices. The discrepancies are jarring. Even though the rise of palliative care and hospice work in the past few years is starting to close that gap, the inability to talk about death continues to get in the way of making better choices. ""Death is not a contagious illness,"" said Dr. Devi. ""But in some ways, we treat it like one. We need to talk about it and get comfortable around it and maybe use VR to experience it. The better the conversation about death, the more likely we'll be to allow more of us to die at home so we're not scared of it."" Conquering those fears has been the focus of recent psychological explorations in VR. While When We Die uses a light meditative touch to approach conversations around death, a Spanish research group recently simulated an out-of-body experience to tackle the full spectrum of thanatophobia (or the fear of dying) in an attempt to reduce anxiety. ""Death is not a contagious illness. But in some ways, we treat it like one. We need to talk about it and get comfortable around it and maybe use VR to experience it."" -- Dr. Gayatri Devi The idea of one's own nonexistence has always been a tough one to conquer. ""But it's a reality and we can't opt out of it,"" said Dr. Devi. ""When you allow yourself into that space of thinking you're dead, where you lose agency over yourself -- that can be a powerful experience. Allowing yourself to sit with that makes you vulnerable and to be able to think about death. You have to allow that to happen."" While some might consider this exploration of death terrifying or even futile, in many cases the practical rewards offer the required motivation. Preparing beforehand, for instance, allows people to get their affairs in order, which unburdens families from making end-of-life decisions. ""When people are faced with death, if they haven't done any preparation, there's too much fear and anxiety to let anything else in,"" Stephanie Hope, the hospice nurse who shares her experiences in When We Die told me. ""It makes it important to talk to people who aren't faced with that yet."" Your browser does not support the audio element Hope, who has been a hospice worker for about four years, points out that when people think about having limited time, they start to withdraw and often show an inclination to spend time with people they're close to. She likens that purposeful shrinking of the world to a kind of intimacy and peace that can be felt in the aloneness of VR. The isolation, which tends to be one of the biggest criticisms of the medium, lends itself to the deeply personal experience of contemplating death. ""You're in your own world and this is your moment,"" said Hope. ""So to think that that's what it might be like at the end for you can be powerful thing."" While the immersive possibilities of VR feel contemporary, tools that address the human predisposition to death have been around for centuries. John Troyer, director of the center for death and society at the University of Bath, traces the lineage of the visual format all the way back to mediumship. ""For me, a lot of it, although a different kind of technology, has a relationship to this idea of connecting with the dead in some way,"" he said. ""To understand any kind of new tool that is supposed to help people think about death, we have to place it in context of the long history of tools that were created by humans to help other humans make sense of their mortality."" Troyer pointed to theatrical experiences like phantasmagoria of the 19th century, which played with themes of monsters and death long before VR. The use of projection systems like magic lanterns turned those imaginative ideas into visual experiences for audiences, which in a way is comparable to the current applications of the immersive technology. The visual trickery of present-day VR, however, is far more profound than its predecessors, both in terms of the visual display as well as its potential for real-world impact. Death-related VR experiences can help prepare people for the inevitable but can also be used to train hospice nurses. Hope believes that bringing VR headsets into nursing school simulation labs, where trainees already work with dummies to stage scenarios, could provide crucial insight into hospice work from a patient's perspective. While hospice workers are trained to care for the dying, physicians are primed to prevent death. ""In medicine we're taught to keep that heart beating,"" said Dr. Devi. ""There's an attitude of 'let's do whatever we can to keep this person's heart beating, even if that doesn't improve their quality of life.' But why are we putting our elderly or very ill patients through these aggressive ways when the outcome is not going to be a good-quality life?"" When We Die doesn't address those questions directly. Instead, it gets at them with an acknowledgement of death as a potentially positive experience. There's an inherent belief that dying is depressing. It continues to be a terrifying unknown because we lack experience in it. But as the VR experience reveals, the tragedy of death isn't true for all.",vr
Tom Regan,There's now also a lower barrier of entry for developers using the tech.,2017-02-22T08:20:00-05:00,Valve's room-scale VR trackers will soon be sold separately,"Valve has announced that it will soon be selling standalone SteamVR Tracking base stations directly. While you could previously order the tech from HTC, later this year, consumers and developers will be able to purchase the new and improved single-rotor tracking model from Valve's online store. With the current standalone tracking stations costing $130 from HTC, the Steam owner states that the move from a dual-rotor to single-rotor design could bring ""rapid cost reductions,"" according to Road To VR. This suggests that the new tracking station may be significantly cheaper. Interestingly, Valve has also seen fit to make life easier for peripheral developers , removing the previously mandatory Seattle-based $3,000 introductory course for new license holders. With the Steam owner developing the tracking technology and HTC creating the Vive headset, its plans to sell the SteamVR base stations separately suggests that Valve still owns the rights to the tech. Whether this means the trackers will eventually be compatible with rival headsets, however, remains to be seen. To date, Valve has revealed that over 500 different companies are developing for the SteamVR base stations. In 2015, VR rival Oculus announced that it had similar plans to open up its tracking system Constellation to third parties. However, the company has failed to mention any news on the initiative since then. With a recent patent suggesting that Sony is hard at work developing its own Vive-inspired sensor , it looks like motion tracking in VR is very much here to stay. While nothing has been formally announced, Valve's decision to decouple the SteamVR sensor from the Vive suggests that the company is expecting a new range of compatible sensors and headsets to appear in the future.",vr
Steve Dent,Developers can now work on Linux games for the Vive.,2017-02-22T07:07:00-05:00,Valve launches SteamVR support for Linux,"Valve has been giving Steam users Linux love since 2012 , and it's not stopping with VR. The company just launched SteamVR for Linux , letting developers create Linux content for the HTC Vive VR headset, trackers and other hardware. The program is in beta, meaning developers must use an NVIDIA developer beta driver that's built on "" Vulkan ,"" the successor to OpenGL. You're limited to ""direct"" mode, meaning you can only display images on the headset and not a desktop display at the same time. We're now live with a developer build of SteamVR for Linux! https://t.co/UbsEC01eDh Developers can also use an AMD card, but it requires more futzing and is limited to secondary ""desktop"" display mode. Intel graphics aren't yet supported, and Linux OpenVR game development requires the Unity version 5.6. There are a few other known issues: Base station power management and headset audio device switching aren't yet implemented, and as mentioned, you can't switch between direct (headset) and desktop display modes. So why is Valve doing VR for what is clearly a very niche market? Valve's SteamOS is Linux-based, and it has hardware partners like Alienware and Maingear that sell Linux machines with the software pre-loaded. There's also a decent library of SteamOS and Linux games, so it makes sense to extend the platform to VR. The company is developing three new VR-specific games itself (using Unity), and it's very possible it will make those available on Linux (and possibly OSX) as well as Windows. On top of that, Valve programmer Joe Ludwig recently said that developers are demanding SteamVR for multiple platforms and that the company is trying to limit ""gatekeepers."" That could be a reference to Windows 10 and its UWP apps, which developers worry Microsoft will use to cut off third-party markets like Steam.",vr

Tilt Brush landed on the HTC Vive in April 2016 and it's generated some awe-inspiring work. To use Tilt Brush on the Oculus Rift, artists will need the system's $200 Touch controllers -- accessories that we found to be incredibly comfortable, responsive and essential for experiencing all the Rift has to offer. Google has customized the Oculus Rift version of Tilt Brush in a few ways: One, while in-app, rest your finger on a button of the Touch controller to see what function it serves. Two, artists are now able to rotate and resize their work. And three, the Rift's built-in headphones offer unique audio feedback for each tool of artistry. ""Different brushes create different sound effects, and they become a vivid part of the experience through your headphones,"" Google writes. ""We love using audio reactive mode with Rift headphones and seeing strokes come to life with light and sound."" Google recently unveiled the Tilt Brush Toolkit , an open-source toolset that allows artists to use their 3D sketches in Unity, adding animations, interactive elements and music to their doodles.",vr

By implementing one of Daydream's best features, of course. Both an FCC filing and an apparent scoop from Roland Quandt indicate that this year's Gear VR will include a one-handed controller -- no more reaching for a touchpad on the headset itself. That's a big deal for games and any other apps that involve more than rudimentary controls. There's precious little else known, but Quandt understands that Samsung's new headset would (to no one's surprise) have a new cover to accommodate both the Galaxy S8 and its upsized S8 Plus counterpart. As for an unveiling? Samsung is believed to be unveiling the S8 on March 29th, so you'll likely get the full story before long.",vr

The main piece of NBA VR is a new series called House of Legends, which the league created in partnership with Digital Domain specifically for viewing in 360-degree video. It's a talk show hosted by former NBA players like Bruce Bowen, Chauncey Billups and Robert Horry, where they'll discuss stories from their careers, pop culture and things happening around the league. NBA VR will also feature other on-demand, 360-degree video content, including highlights and tours of teams' arenas. The application is exclusive to Daydream and available in the US, UK, Canada, Australia and Germany. If you have one of Google's new headsets, you can check out NBA VR starting today for free.

You're trapped in a tight space and have to lie perfectly still as loud noises -- produced by the current in the scanner coils -- pepper your eardrums. To help patients, and in particular children, the Kings College Hospital in London has turned to VR. MRI physicist Jonathan Ashmore and technologist Jerome Di Pietro have produced an app that contains a 360-degree video. Slip on a Google Cardboard and you'll see what happens on the day, from arrival to stepping inside the scanner. ""I was given a 360-degree camera as a present,"" Ashmore explains, ""and I wanted to use it to help anxious children I see come into the hospital."" Offering a sneak peek of the day can put young patients at ease. Matthew Down, a 10-year-old who has to have annual MRI scans, recalls how he was ""really worried"" before his first scan. ""I didn't know what to expect. Even though my dad explained, I couldn't imagine what it would be like."" Trialling the app, he said it could be ""really helpful"" for first-timers. The app is free to download , and will soon be available on iOS too. The videos are simple, but they could have a huge impact on the UK health system. If children are more comfortable, they're less likely to require a general anaesthetic. The whole process should be quicker too, making the NHS a more efficient operation -- both in terms of money and time. For now ""My MRI"" is just a trial, with a link to the app included in select appointment letters. Ashmore hopes it will be expanded in the future , however, so that VR headsets are readily available in waiting rooms.",vr

History geeks will thrill to find out that George Washington's dentures weren't actually wooden, as is popularly thought, but rather made from human and cow teeth (and some ivory). Fans of more recent presidents might like to see Barbara Bush's handwritten taco recipe, which features Doritos as the first ingredient. That's just two of the more than 2,000 artifacts in the collection , which includes 158 exhibits in total -- a ton of information to get lost in. There are virtual tours of presidents' homes, insights into their childhoods and even sections on favorite pastimes. That's all in addition to our commander-in-chiefs' more public accomplishments. The massive archive includes pictures, video and text sourced from more than 30 institutions from across the nation, including individual presidential libraries, museums and historical institutions from across the nation. It joins the rest of Google's plans to bring important cultural , artistic and historical works to the web. In addition to the thousands of artifacts in this new collection, Google has made 17 new 360-degree virtual tours available, as well.

Jon Fingas,It's promising much more than a glorified slot for your phone.,2017-02-15T10:42:00-05:00,HTC's mobile VR headset won't be a copycat,"HTC is quickly establishing itself as a virtual reality-focused company, and that's evident with its plans to enter the mobile VR arena. In an interview with CNET , company sales President Chia-lin Chang has revealed that it's launching a mobile VR headset in 2017 (teased last year ) that is ""not a phone slapped onto a headset."" It's not just another spin on the familiar Gear VR or Daydream View formulas, to put it another way. The exec drew parallels to the Vive , which targets the high end of the PC-based VR space. Given the Vive's relative success (it managed to upstage the Oculus Rift to a degree), it's not surprising that HTC would bet on conquering mobile VR as well. The question is whether or not this bet on VR will work. Although the Vive has helped stem the bleeding, HTC is still losing money -- a second headset isn't guaranteed to bring the company back to profitability. It's still too soon to tell how large the VR market will get, and HTC may end up becoming the champion of a category that never truly reaches the mainstream.",vr
Tom Regan,It looks like PSVR could become even more immersive.,2017-02-15T09:44:00-05:00,Sony files patent for Vive-style PSVR tracking device,"Sony is experimenting with its own Vive-style VR tracking device, according to a patent filing from June. The document hints at a tracker working similarly to HTC's current virtual reality tech. Functioning as an external projector, the device would use lights and mirrors to map the player's real world movements straight into PSVR. While Sony's VR offering currently uses a camera to detect light from the player's headset, the existing tracking limits users to an incredibly small space. With light often interfering with the PS4's camera, if this new tech makes it to production it could not only give gamers more mobility but also potentially provide a more accurate and immersive PSVR experience. While merely filing a patent doesn't guarantee that the tech will ever see the light of day, Sony investing in a more immersive PSVR experience makes a lot of sense. Being able to physically walk around a virtual world does wonders for creating a feeling of presence and if it makes it to market, this new device could help PSVR stand toe-to-toe with the more technically accomplished Vive. Interestingly, the patent states that the tracking device is wireless, suggesting it would connect to a PS4 through either Bluetooth or Wi-Fi. With the competition already announcing wireless peripherals of their own , it's no surprise that Sony may be following in their footsteps.The patent gives no indication, however, whether the tracker would be an add-on for the existing headset or incorporated as a part of a PSVR successor. PSVR was released last October. Since then, Sony has kept quiet about the tech, omitting sales numbers from end of year press releases and failing to announce many new titles for the platform at its last conference. Yet with more bundles hitting the shelves and Sony's recently released PS4 Pro offering a noticeable bump in VR performance, these patents help suggest that the company's not done with VR just yet.",vr

Trading large, wraparound screens for small, immersive headsets, the facility allows anyone to experience VR without buying a high-end gaming PC or video game console. As UploadVR reports , the LA center has a mixture of HTC Vive and Starbreeze StarVR headsets. They're stored in 14 isolated ""pods"" which also contain a Dbox cinema chair, a vibration-emitting Subpac vest and a variety of physical controllers. You can buy experiences individually, such as John Wick Chronicles , or grab a ""sampler"" if you want a broader taste of VR. IMAX has been teasing its VR centers for almost a year now. Since then, we've seen other cinema chains, such as MK2 in Paris , construct similar installations dedicated to virtual immersion. The idea is simple: most people have never tried the Oculus Rift or HTC Vive, due to a lack of funds or space in their living room. There's also a group of people who just want to try the occasional experience -- if you're a climbing fan, for instance, you might want to play Sólfar Studios' Everest VR , but little else. With IMAX VR, you can now access these experiences on a pay-as-you-go basis. At launch, IMAX has a mixture of immersive games and movies including Star Wars: Trials on Tatooine , Eagle Flight and The Walk. To stand out, IMAX is also working on exclusive content. It's not ready just yet, but the company has raised $50 million to aid its development and the construction of additional VR centers. These are planned for New York, California, China and the UK.

Logically, Oculus Touch support is present if you'd prefer a more hands-on approach. You can download Everest VR right now for $15. As with most VR titles, though, you'll need a reasonably modern Windows PC to handle the Oculus Rift experience. The developers recommend at least a 4th-generation quad Core i5 processor, 8GB of RAM and a GeForce GTX 960 to make the most of it.

Billy Steele,Move around Lyndhurst Hall as Joshua Bell records a violin performance.,2017-02-14T11:46:00-05:00,Sony made a PSVR music video you can move around in,"When it comes to the immersive visuals virtual reality offers, the audio needs to be equally as compelling. That includes having the sound adapt to your movements as you navigate a scene or event. To show off what its PlayStation VR setup is capable of, Sony enlisted violinist Joshua Bell to record a 360-degree virtual reality studio session. With adaptive audio and positional tracking, the company offers the ability for you to ""step inside"" the venue a lot more realistic. Sony used its FDR-X1000V action cameras to capture video and rendered the full scene in 3D. This means that viewers can not only look around, but they're free to move around the room as well thanks to PSVR's positional tracking. Of course, having the audio adapt as you change positions is equally as important and that's just what Sony has done here. Using specially placed microphones to capture sound, positional audio tracking changes what you hear as you navigate Air Studios' Lyndhurst Hall in London. If you move closer to the artist, you can hear more detail from the violin. If you back away, you get more of the natural reverb and overall sound of the room. The company explains that capturing something like this would typically take a lot more equipment. However, this setup allows for a less cumbersome method for documenting an informal event in VR. Sony says the next step is to simplify the process so that it can easily be used to capture not only musical performances , but theatre and sporting events as well. It will be interesting to see how the company continues to develop ways for people to produce content for PlayStation VR beyond just games. If you have PSVR gear, the Joshua Bell performance is available for free. For those who haven't yet committed, you can check out a behind-the-scenes look at the project in the video below.",vr
Mariella Moon,They can prevent headaches and nausea caused by virtual reality experiences.,2017-02-14T07:03:00-05:00,Scientists are making VR displays that match your eyesight,"One of the reasons why VR games and experiences cause headache and nausea is because headsets' displays can't optimize images for your eyes. A team of Stanford scientists seek to change that by developing VR displays that can adjust how images are shown based on your age and any other existing condition. For example, a lot of older people have a harder time focusing on objects close to them than younger people do. ""Every person needs a different optical mode to get the best possible experience in VR,"" lead researcher Gordon Wetzstein explained. The researchers have already begun testing software fixes and two different types of hardware options. Since the main problem with current displays is that they make it difficult for your eyes to focus on one point due to their proximity to your face, the prototypes were designed to solve the issue. One of them uses liquid lenses that can be adjusted by squeezing a dial, while the other works like binoculars and moves the display screen back and forth. Both of them incorporate an eye-tracking technology to figure out where you're looking. At the moment, the prototypes can only help you if you are nearsighted, farsighted or presbyopic, but it can't help you with, say, astigmatism. The researchers say this is only the beginning, though, and they're hoping their ""research findings [can] guide these developments in the industry.""",vr

Not just little experiments either, like the room-scale mini-game collection The Lab. Real, proper video games. ""When I say we're building three games, we're building three full games, not experiments,"" he said, according to Eurogamer. Few other details were disclosed, such as whether the team was working on new or existing IP. Newell did explain why the company had returned to video game development, however. Now that the HTC Vive is on the market, Valve is in a position to develop hardware and software simultaneously. Like Nintendo, this gives it an advantage over typical game studios. ""This is something that [Nintendo designer Shigeru] Miyamoto has always had,"" he said. ""He's had the ability to think about what the input device is and design a system while de designs games. Our sense is that this will actually allow us to build much better entertainment experiences for people."" Valve's support makes sense. For VR to thrive, it needs compelling software. Headset sales are low right now, so it can be tough to persuade developers to make new, tailored games for the platform. Valve, on the other hand, has a huge incentive to make VR a success given its role with both the hardware (the Vive) and distribution (Steam).

Chrome's stable version now supports WebVR , a JavaScript API necessary for experiences loaded on browsers to work on a VR device. Google introduced WebVR support in Chrome beta for Android last year, but now you don't have to stick with the browser's experimental channel anymore. Megan Lindsay, Chrome's product manager, listed a number of VR content you can load on your phone and view on Daydream right now. They include the 300,000+ celeb homes and tourist attractions on Matterport , as well as the Bear71 nature documentary. Within gives you access to award-winning virtual reality films, while Sketchfab features VR scenes from various videos games, anime and other sources. You can also pick up and play with objects using your Daydream controller on PlayCanvas' WebVR Lab. This list is bound to expand, since Google is encouraging developers to sign up and make their creations viewable on Daydream. You'll of course have to use a Daydream-ready phone like the Pixel to access all those on the headset. But when Google launches WebVR support for other headsets like the Cardboard -- and it plans to do so in the future -- you can use other smartphones' Chrome browser. The company is also working to add WebVR support to Chrome on computers for the sake of desktop VR headsets like the Oculus Rift.",vr

Steve Dent,Virtual images blend with the real world via the Gear VR's passthrough camera option.,2017-02-08T12:41:00-05:00,Six Flags and Samsung unveil 'mixed reality' rollercoaster,"To many of us, roller coasters are just fine without extra visual stimulation. However, last year, several amusement parks introduced virtual reality devices, letting you fly through space or a gargoyle-infested dystopia. Six Flags and Samsung have done that one better now with the New Revolution Galactic Attack mixed reality experience. As before, Six Flags is using Samsung's Gear VR headset, but now it's using the passthrough camera on the Galaxy phones, letting you see the virtual content overlaid on the real world. Samsung says the Six Flags experience ""enables millions of consumers to experience virtual reality for the first time."" However, the passthrough camera on the Gear VR won't deliver mixed reality that's as good as something like Microsoft's Hololens , which overlays virtual content onto the real world, not a camera view. However, it'll at least give folks a view of the outside rather than locking them in a digital box. On top of the virtual imagery, there's a level of gamification. ""As riders drop at high speeds, the mixed reality view changes to a completely immersive, virtual reality environment and a fighter spaceship cockpit materializes and envelops the riders into a tunnel of light,"" the PR breathlessly explains. From there, you'll be brought into one of three (virtual) drone bays, ""each of which offer a completely different gaming experience and three different endings,"" Six Flags explains. As before, the VR is synchronized to the ride movements, so that you don't experience any not-so-virtual puking. The featured ride at Six Flags Magic Mountain in Valencia, CA is the New Revolution, the first-ever looping roller coaster built in 1976. While not the park's most diabolic ride, the LA Times advises riders to keep their heads back ""or you'll get your ears boxed.""

Developer KennyW has successfully ported a basic rendering of Valve's wildly popular first person puzzle-shooter to play on Microsoft's augmented reality hardware, and the result is just as trippy as you'd expect. Since this is just a proof-of-concept, there are no puzzles to solve just yet, but it does turn a boring old office building into a mind-bending Aperture Science playground. While the HoloLens-wearing test subjects unfortunately (fortunately?) can't step through the portals themselves, an AR Weighted Companion Cube behaves just as it would in the game -- even tumbling down stairs and bouncing off of other real-world objects as it knocks over a rendered sentry gun. As Kenny told The Next Web , getting the basic game mechanics working on the HoloLens was a seemingly simple matter of re-building the game inside the developer-friendly Unity engine. All we need now is for someone to tie the VR and AR versions together into one incredibly confusing shared reality.",vr

Sean Buckley,,2017-02-03T15:10:00-05:00,'Psychonauts' in VR is a story Tim Schafer never planned to tell,"Tim Schafer's Psychonauts is the definition of a modern cult classic. Despite winning multiple awards and the adoration of critics, Double Fine's first game sold poorly. Good games, however, don't go unplayed. Over the course of a decade, Psychonauts sold over a million copies in digital redistribution and left fans clamoring for a sequel to wrap up the game's loose ends. Now a satisfying conclusion to the original game's story is finally here, but it's not Psychonauts 2 -- it's Psychonauts in the Rhombus of Ruin , a virtual-reality spinoff heading exclusively to PlayStation VR on February 21st. It's almost poetic. Just as Psychonauts was Double Fine's first game as a new-development studio, Psychonauts in the Rhombus of Ruin is the company's first game made exclusively for virtual reality -- and it picks up the story exactly where the original game left it. Rasputin (""Raz,"" for short) has officially been inducted into a group of psychic secret agents and is heading out on his first mission: to rescue Truman Zannotto, the leader of the Psychonauts. For anyone who played the original game , it seems like an obvious place to resume the narrative. Schafer, on the other hand, says it's a story he never planned to tell. ""We weren't going to tell the story about you running off to save the head of the Psychonauts,"" he told me in an interview this week at the company's San Francisco office. Schafer always imagined the rescue operation happening off screen, with any prospective sequels picking up after the team had returned to headquarters. ""We thought it would just be referred to,"" he said. ""Oh, remember that time we went and saved the president of the Psychonauts?"" That's still the plan for the game's crowdfunded sequel , but the company's VR project gave Schafer a new platform for storytelling. ""It seemed like a natural fit. ""We could actually tell this story, this secret mission you go on in-between these two games, and still make it a standalone, fun spy adventure."" Adventure is the key word, too. Unlike the original game, a 3D platformer, Psychonauts in the Rhombus of Ruin is a first-person take on the point-and-click adventure akin to Broken Age or the SCUMM games Shafer used to make at LucasArts. The player wears the PlayStation VR headset to settle behind the eyes of Raz, and uses his psychic powers to interact with the world. You can use telekinesis to open doors, flip switches and interact with items, distract enemies with PSI-blasts and light things on fire with pyrokinesis. It works surprisingly well, locking the power to the center of your vision. As I watched a book I was intently staring at rise off the ground, I almost felt like I actually had psychic powers. The psychic make-believe works great, but as a player, you don't move much. The game is played entirely from a seated position, a restriction imposed by Schafer himself. ""I get really uncomfortable and have simulation sickness ,"" he said. ""We wanted to know our game would be playable to everybody, including people susceptible to that."" Rhombus gets around Schafer's movement constraint by using Raz's power of clairvoyance to let the player see through the eyes of any character in her vision. It's a twist on the ""teleportation"" gimmick common to seated VR experiences , backing up the warp-based travel mechanic with the game's lore. ""It's not just a random teleportation,"" Schafer said. ""You're using clairvoyance to see the world from someone else's point of view."" It's more than just an excuse to let the seated player see more of the world, though -- it's an empathic experience. Some characters in the game perceive the world differently than Raz, and while using clairvoyance, the player can see those discrepancies first-hand. ""Everyone doesn't just see the world from a different 3D space,"" Schafer said. ""They see it from a different emotional place, too. We try to show that with the gameplay."" This adds a twist to the traditional adventure-game mechanics Rhombus thrives on. Sure, you're looking for clues for physical puzzles in the game world, but you're also looking for clues on how to help other characters based on how they personally see that world. ""You have to understand what they're going through in order to figure out what would help them get out of it,"" Schafer said. It adds a layer of empathy to the game's puzzles. ""Getting inside someone's mind helps you see their world, feel their pain, see what scares them."" Schafer describes it as the game's emotional core. ""I think at its root, Psychonauts has always been about empathy."" Tim Schafer adds one more thing as I pack up and leave his office. ""Did I mention the game's fun?"" It is.",vr
Andrew Dalton,Collaborating across a mixed reality space is surprisingly simple.,2017-02-01T21:21:00-05:00,Developer combines HoloLens and Vive for 'shared reality',"As fun and immersive as virtual reality is, watching your friend play around in a completely computer-generated environment doesn't have quite the same impact when watching it on a flat monitor or TV screen. But now, thanks to the vivid augmented reality of Microsoft's HoloLens and the developer-friendly HTC Vive, virtual and augmented reality can be easily combined so observers can share in the VR experience. On his blog, software developer Drew Gottlieb detailed his proof of concept setup , which allows the HoloLens user to see what the Vive user is drawing in mid-air. After building a rudimentary 3D painting app similar to Tilt Brush , Gottlieb simply connected the Vive and the HoloLens over Unity's networking service. Once the HoloLens was calibrated to track the Vive controller, the two worlds became synchronized. While the system isn't perfect, the ""quick and dirty solution works better than expected,"" Gottlieb writes, and there's no limit to the how many HoloLens observers can join in. The VR headset also becomes unnecessary, so anyone with a HoloLens can pick up the motion controllers and start drawing shapes floating in the real world. With engineers already using the HoloLens to visualize architecture in the real world , it's not hard to see how collaborative features like this would be extremely useful for creative industries in the future.",vr

A Texas jury has determined that Oculus must pay $500 million to ZeniMax over claims that Palmer Luckey didn't comply with a non-disclosure agreement he signed with the game publisher. However, what didn't happen is more telling. The jury found that Oculus didn't steal trade secrets from ZeniMax when it hired John Carmack. In other words, one of the cornerstones of the case didn't hold up. Neither side is going to be all that happy with the results. ZeniMax had been asking for $4 billion in compensation and damages -- it's only getting an eighth of that. Oculus, meanwhile, won't be pleased at having to pay anything. It maintained its innocence from the start, and has long characterized the lawsuit as both a cash grab (to take advantage of all that Facebook money) and a sign of jealousy after losing a game industry legend like Carmack. We've reached out to both companies and will let you know what (if anything) they intend to do next, although Oculus has already said that it plans to appeal. It's safe to say that Facebook and Oculus aren't about to change course on their virtual reality plans any time soon, and that ZeniMax isn't about to drop its technology theft accusations.",vr
Devindra Hardawar,It offers a glimpse at the future of VR filmmaking.,2017-02-01T12:00:00-05:00,'My Brother's Keeper' uses new VR tech to reenact the Civil War,"A story about two estranged brothers facing off on a Civil War battlefield might seem like a strange fit for a virtual reality film, but My Brother's Keeper isn't your typical VR movie. The PBS film, which premiered at Sundance last week, uses its period setting to show off several new filmmaking techniques, including the first 120 fps slow-motion recording in VR and the use of a customized action camera rig. But most important, it uses all of that technical wizardry to craft a genuinely moving story. My Brother's Keeper is set around the battle of Antietam, which is notorious for being the deadliest single-day fight in American history. Amid the conflict -- which involves over 150 Civil War reenactors -- the two brothers find themselves on opposite sides of the struggle. At a short running time of nine minutes, we only get glimpses at their lives, but they're enough to make an emotional impact. The film, which was written and directed by Connor Hair and Alex Meader and produced by StoryTech Immersive and Perception Squared together with the Technicolor Experience Center, is also partially inspired by the PBS Civil War series Mercy Street. ""We are witnessing the birth of a new medium, so there is a lot for us to learn and invent at every point in the process; from pre-production, production, post-production and distribution, there is a lot of innovation happening,"" PBS producer Don Wilcox said in an email to Engadget. ""Hardware continues to improve, capabilities expand, and shooting and editing techniques continue to mature. One thing that will help us over time is the development of standard formats -- today just about every platform has its own requirements, which creates extra work and inconsistency in what viewers ultimately see, depending on their device."" There's no shortage of ways to view My Brother's Keeper. It's available on just about every VR video platform, including YouTube, Facebook, VivePort (for HTC's Vive), Oculus Rift and Samsung Video for the Gear VR. You can also view it in standard 2D 360-degree video on YouTube and Facebook, but those options only match a fraction of the experience. With a VR headset, you get a full stereoscopic 3D view of the film, which offers much more depth and clarity than the flat version. Based on the VR films I've seen so far -- which include Obama's ode to Yosemite and his farewell tour of the White House -- there's little reason to watch one that isn't rendered in 3D. The whole point of strapping on a VR headset is to achieve a sense of ""presence,"" the idea that you're transported somewhere else and watching it in person. That's a tough sensation to convey when you're just watching a 2D video wrapped around your eyes. In My Brother's Keeper , the 3D filming was particularly striking in its long shots of wheat fields and battle scenes, as well as close-ups of the lead actors. As for the new things the film brings to the table, I particularly enjoyed its implementation of slow motion. The filmmakers were the first to use Jaunt's VR rig to achieve 120 fps recording, and the result is a silky smooth virtual image. It almost feels like time is slowing down around you a bit. The effect is mostly used during the battle scenes, which gives you time to soak in the detail in the actors' costumes and the carnage happening around you. Helping out the slow motion is a new action rig, which allows the camera to smoothly flow through space. (Typically VR filmmakers just plop their cameras down in a single spot.) I wasn't as big a fan of the film's use of 180-degree framing, which basically just blurs a large portion of the image to focus on what's in front of you. It feels a bit like the shallow-focus trend we're seeing in TV shows and films today (like how the show Louie is shot), but it's needlessly limiting in VR. I actually thought something was wrong with the Daydream headset I was wearing the first time I saw the blurry effect. And as Wilcox tells us, there are still plenty of challenges for shooting in VR: ""There is no 'fourth wall' since the camera can see in all directions,"" he noted. ""This creates challenges for the crew, who need to get out of the shot. This required us to hide behind trees, haystacks and cornfields to stay out of sight."" Actors also have to be more mindful of their own performances, since they can't be closely monitored by the director. Wilcox describes VR postproduction as ""significantly"" more complex than traditional films. ""Camera rigs must be painted out, visual effects have to be rendered multiple times to fill the surround format and stitching together the different camera views takes skill and precision,"" he said. In My Brother's Keeper , we can see glimpses of where VR filmmaking is headed. As a medium, VR is still very much in an early stage, and there are bound to be issues as artists explore new technology and techniques. But that just makes the successful attempts that much more exciting.",vr

Edgar Alvarez,The company’s new app lets shoppers try on clothes from home.,2017-01-30T14:59:00-05:00,Gap envisions a future with augmented-reality 'dressing rooms',"Fashion brands know experimenting with tech is imperative, whether it be to enhance the retail experience or introduce fans to the concept of virtual reality. For Gap Inc., which, in addition to its eponymous label owns Banana Republic, Old Navy, Athleta and Intermix, technology has never played a major role in its business strategy. But as the company struggles with declining sales, it's trying to find creative ways to engage with customers. That's where Gap's ""DressingRoom"" app will come in when it launches in the coming days. The application, built in collaboration with Google and San Francisco-based startup Avametric , uses augmented reality to let shoppers ""try on"" clothes without having to step into a store. After you add information such as her height and weight, DressingRoom places a virtual 3D model in front of you and lets you see how different items would fit. If you like the way a garment looks on you, or at least looks on the mannequin based on your measurements, you can purchase it directly from the app. While retailers have been experimenting with virtual try-ons for years, Gap is among the first to add an AR twist to the idea. As compelling as the idea may be, it does have its limitations. For starters, it's exclusive to Google Tango smartphones, and right now there are barely any of those available. So far, there's only Lenovo's Phab2 Pro , and ASUS isn't expected to release its ZenFone AR until later this year. Gap says that for the time being, it's focused only on making its application work on Google's augmented-reality platform. That's great news for the search giant, which needs more willing partners like Gap in order for Tango to be a success. The other issue is that some people, myself included, would prefer to physically try on the clothes before making a decision. I'm probably not the only person who feels this way, although as a techie I'm curious to give it a shot. Avametric, whose tech powers the app, says it's already working with other brands and retailers on similar projects, but, unfortunately, the company couldn't disclose much beyond that. When asked why choose AR over VR to build DressingRoom, Avametric CEO Ari Bloom suggested augmented reality has a gentler learning curve. He says the hardware and software required for virtual reality has more ""immediate barriers,"" because you have to learn new behaviors to interact with things around you. Mixed reality, meanwhile, continues to be an appealing technology for many developers , with the success of Pokémon Go being perhaps the most prominent example. DressingRoom likely won't solve all, if any, of Gap's problems. The company has been struggling in recent years, having suffered seven consecutive quarters of declining sales , according to Investopedia. It has logged strong holiday numbers this winter, but by that point Gap had already announced it was closing more than 175 of its namesake stores. Gil Krakowsky, VP of strategy and business development for Gap, says DressingRoom is just one of initiatives his team is working on to lure shoppers back in -- particularly those who don't visit its brick-and-mortar locations. Gap isn't the only mainstream retailer in a slump. Last month, Macy's revealed it will cut 10,000 jobs after mediocre sales during the holidays. The company blamed some of its troubles on tech giant Amazon , which has won over customers with its own fashion section , low prices and expedited shipping for Prime members. As a result, Macy's had to close 100 stores and said it would start focusing on its ""digital business,"" though it's not clear what that means. Macy's declined to comment for this story, but one could assume this means placing more resources on its online site and apps. As for Gap, Krakowsky says it's too early to know if DressingRoom will have any positive financial impact. He says his team will see how customers respond to the app, which is set to launch on Google Play soon. ""The fashion industry,"" he says, ""has not traditionally been geared toward helping people understand how clothes will actually fit,"" and he believes DressingRoom is an opportunity to change that. We'll see how that turns out.",vr
Jessica Conditt,,2017-01-28T11:00:00-05:00,'Resident Evil 7' is the most terrifying VR game on the market,"I didn't recognize Resident Evil 7: Biohazard when Capcom revealed it at E3 2016 with a mysterious teaser trailer. To begin with, it was a first-person game, when Resident Evil is famously a third-person perspective series. Secondly, the trailer showcased a dilapidated, cockroach-filled house that looked like it would fit in a modern horror title like Amnesia or Outlast , rather than Resident Evil 's universe of Raccoon City and the Umbrella Corporation. However, when the jump scares were done and the title screen appeared, I couldn't help gasping in surprise -- and pure joy. Resident Evil , one of my favorite gaming franchises of all time, was back and it looked as terrifying as ever, even as a first-person shooter. What's more, it would be fully playable in virtual reality on the PlayStation 4. All of my most nightmarish dreams were coming true. That is, until I actually played Resident Evil 7 on PlayStation VR. I had plenty of experience with Oculus Rift, HTC Vive and PS VR, and I'd never experienced the dreaded ""VR sickness"" that ruined these experiences for some of my peers. At least, not until the Resident Evil 7 E3 demo. About half-way through my playthrough , streaming live on Facebook, I started to feel feverish and sweaty, and minutes later I had to pull the PS VR off my face and stop the demo early. I raced to the bathroom, fearing I was going to vomit all over Sony's booth. Even after that bout of tummy-rumbling trauma, I still loved the idea of Resident Evil 7 in VR. When I finally held the full game in my hands, playing in VR was the first thought on my mind. Between E3 and release, Capcom had been toying with the VR mode and I had to try it again. So, I did. On camera, of course. The final version of Resident Evil 7 in VR is not as puke-inducing as the initial demo I played, but it still made me sweaty and hot -- a precursor to full-blown, nauseating VR sickness. But despite some pre-puke symptoms, Resident Evil 7 is a fantastic survival horror game, inside and outside of VR. It proudly carries on the series' traditions of puzzle-solving quests, horrifying boss fights, laser-sight shooting and inventory management, but this time around, it's all packaged in a gorgeous first-person world. Well, it's ""gorgeous"" or ""hellish, blood-spattered and completely soul-shattering."" It's all just a matter of perspective.",vr

Plug in an adapter, microphone or game controller, then keep it moving. All of that changes, however, when it comes to virtual reality. As Oculus explains , plugging in a bunch of room scale sensors sends enough data through the ports to potentially overwhelm the 400MB/s capacity of the controller chip on your motherboard. Because of this, the answer isn't to simply plug in a hub and get more high-speed USB 3.0 ports, in fact, Oculus says you should probably get good results by using two USB 3.0 connections, plus one older USB 2.0 port if you need to go beyond two sensors to get some more mobility in your VR experiences.

But the ultimate judgement is now in the hands of a jury. As reported by Polygon, closing arguments have concluded and the jury now has to decided if Oculus chief technology officer John Carmack stole ZeniMax IP and brought it to Oculus when he joined the company in 2013. At the same time as it wrapped up closing arguments, ZeniMax doubled the damages it is asking for. The company now wants a grand total of $4 billion -- $2 billion in compensation and $2 billion in punitive damages. However, the case again Oculus doesn't seem terribly strong. ZeniMax argued that Oculus creator Palmer Luckey essentially didn't have the technical know-how to build the Oculus Rift on his own without Carmack's help. They said that Luckey and Carmack, who had been working at ZeniMax until he left to join Oculus, used ZeniMax's technology Rage VR testbed and Doom 3 BFG Edition code to built out the Rift's software (ZeniMax is the owner of id Software, creators of the Doom series). In its defense, Oculus and its parent company Facebook had a forensics expert testify that there are no parts of the Rage VR or Doom 3 BFG Edition source code in the Oculus code. Furthermore, Oculus employees testified that they never saw any of Carmack's source code or stated that they developed their code independently. During the trial, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg testified , as did Luckey , Carmack and former Oculus VR CEO Brendan Iribe. Throughout the suit, which was first filed way back in 2014 , Facebook, Oculus and the key players involved have all been steadfast in maintaining their innocence.

Street price: $2,400; MSRP: $2,400; Deal price: $2,100 This $300 drop is the best price we've seen to date, and for the top of the line MacBook Pro, it's quite a good deal. It's available in Space Gray and Silver, with limited quantities available. The MacBook Pro 15-inch is our absolute performance pick in our guide to which MacBook Pro you should buy. Dan Frakes wrote, ""The 15-inch MacBook Pro is Apple's flagship laptop, designed specifically for people who need the best possible performance: In addition to its 2880×1800, 15-inch Retina display—which has the same increased brightness and color gamut as the 13-inch 2016 models—the 15-inch MacBook Pro is the only Mac laptop with a quad-core Intel Core i7 processor, and it has faster graphics processors (including both integrated and discrete GPUs), faster RAM, and faster storage."" Street price: $700; MSRP: $700; Deal price: $600 This is a nice deal on the Oculus Rift Headset. While the headset itself is full price, this deal includes a $100 Best Buy Gift card. That $100 gift card would represent half the cost of the touch controllers, a strongly recommended Rift accessory. The Oculus Rift headset is a top pick in our upcoming VR Headset guide. Signe Brewster writes, ""The Oculus Rift hits the sweet spot for accessibility and ability, especially now that the Touch controllers are available. Its sensors track you as you move around, and the controllers accurately and intuitively replicate your hand movements in virtual worlds. There are plenty of games, movies and other experiences in the Oculus Store, and it can play most SteamVR games as well. Compared to the HTC Vive and Playstation VR, the headset is lighter and the controllers are smaller and make more sense to use. Its on-ear headphones sound great and require zero thought, unlike the competition's earbuds, which tend to fall out."" Street price: $285; MSRP: $400; Deal price: $200 This is the best price we've seen on our top pick for best handheld GPS by far, coming in stover $80 below the recent street price. While we've been seeing the street price gradually drop over the past year, this is a huge deal and a great price to pick up this handheld GPS. The Garmin Oregon 600 is our top pick in our guide to the best handheld GPS. Kit Dillon wrote, ""If you're serious about charting and waypointing the unknown, the Garmin Oregon 600 is the backcountry GPS to get. It has the best touchscreen display of any stand-alone GPS device we've tested, and is chock-full of all the standard and advanced features of any great backcountry GPS, including microSD slot for extra maps, 1.7 GB of built-in memory, and GPS/GLONASS dual-system antennas."" Street price: $140; MSRP: $210; Deal price: $90 This is a nice deal on the Vantrue R2 dash cam and matches the lowest price we've seen. In addition, like one of the past Newegg deals on this dash cam we've posted, it includes a bonus in the form of a $10 Newegg promotional gift card. Shipping is free to most states. The Vantrue R2 is our runner-up pick for the best dash cam. Eric Adams writes, ""Its packaging, instructions, and general usability are on a par with the Z3, and its image quality is also top notch. While just as crisp as the Z3, the R2's images have slightly more contrast. This makes them more attractive, but not quite as useful as they could be in different scenarios, as some areas tend to be too dark, and the night vision is also a hair darker."" Adams turns to quality and value, ""It also has a slightly wider 170° field of view, which exceeds our preference just a bit. But we're hair-splitting here: Both the R2 and our top pick, the Z3, are sensational cameras.... If you like its slightly better photographic output or you need a dash cam right away and the Z3 is unavailable, we recommend the R2."" Deals change all the time, and some of these may have expired.

Steve Dent,Claude Zellweger also designed the HTC One smartphone.,2017-01-26T07:02:00-05:00,HTC's head of design is joining Google Daydream,"It's a game of musical chairs lately in the VR world. On the same day that Xiaomi's Hugo Barra revealed he would head Facebook's Oculus VR division, HTC VP of Design Claude Zellweger tweeted that he's moving to Google's Daydream VR project. A reliable source tells Engadget that he actually departed last July, but stayed on during a grace period, much as former CEO Peter Chou did in 2015. Zellweger not only headed up the creation of the HTC Vive, he and One & Co. partner Scott Croyle were responsible for the design of the original HTC One smartphone. Of late, Zellweger has focused on the Vive's design, but as we detailed in a 2015 profile , he created much of the design language at HTC. The Taiwanese company bought his One & Co. design firm way back in 2008, and after Scott Croyle departed in 2014, followed by his successor Jonah Becker the next year, Zellweger was the last member of the original team. Daniel Hundt currently heads HTC's smartphone design division, while Vive is now a separate, fully owned subsidiary. The Vive team created numerous prototypes of the headset and controller before arriving at the final consumer model. Their work paid off, though as most critics consider it ahead of the Oculus Rift in terms of technology (though not comfort), with more realistic tracking and images. That expertise will no doubt be a big help to the Google's VR team. The Daydream was surprisingly good, for a mobile headset, but the search giant no doubt has bigger plans with it. Hopefully we'll learn a bit more about those in May at Google's big I/O conference , the event where it first revealed the original Daydream concept. Update : HTC has confirmed Zellweger's departure, saying ""we appreciate his considerable contirubtion to HTC and wish him well in his future endeavors."" Its full statement is below: HTC can confirm that Claude Zellweger has left the Company. We appreciate his considerable contribution to HTC, and wish him well in his future endeavors. HTC continues to invest in talent and recruitment as part of our broader strategy to ensure the continued strength and integrity of the company's organizational structure.",vr

As Barra revealed a couple of days ago, he's coming back to Silicon Valley and will ""lead all of our virtual reality efforts, including our Oculus team."" This fills the hole left when former Oculus CEO Brendan Iribe stepped down to focus on the company's PC efforts in December, as Barra becomes the VP of VR at Facebook. The announcement came along with a pic of Zuckerberg and Barra hanging out virtually , since the new VR exec is still in China. In a comment on the post, Barra said ""It's been a dream of mine to work in virtual reality even back when AR/VR were just figments of science fiction; now we're taking selfies in virtual worlds,"" and stated his plan is to take the technology mainstream.

Now's your chance.,2017-01-25T01:28:00-05:00,'Knockout League' brings cartoony boxing to virtual reality,"The Nintendo Switch has Arms and now the VR-minded folks at Grab Games and Vive Studios have dropped Knockout League onto Steam's Early Access label. The arcade-y boxing game's in-development version only has four cartoony pugilists for now, according to VentureBeat , but each one has a different fighting style. And some aren't even human. Like Sir Octopunch, a mustachioed octopus with a stance like an old timey English boxer. Sure! It's more Ready 2 Rumble in tone and presentation than, say, Fight Night 's simulation leanings, but the aesthetic works really well based on footage from the trailer below. VB reports that the full version should be ready by the second quarter this year (so, some time between April and June) and should have some additional bits by then. For now, the version with a quartet of boxers will run you $18. Time to lace up the gloves... err, Vive wands and Oculus Touch controllers.",vr
Jon Fingas,The Forever update adds modes that will test even the most dedicated fans.,2017-01-24T20:42:00-05:00,'Superhot VR' is about to get much more challenging,"Superhot VR is an immersive, intense take on an already fun game, but there's no question that it's short when you can run out of things to do in just a few hours. Never fear, though: the creators are preparing the Forever update, which promises a number of good reasons to keep coming back to the Oculus Touch shooter. You can try to beat your best scores in both the usual bullet time mode as well as real time, and face opponents with quicker reflexes. You'll also find a few challenges that ramp up the difficulty if the very act of dodging bullets isn't enough for you. Some of them are straightforward, such as having to land headshots to kill enemies or completing the game using only melee combat. However, there's at least one over-the-top mode: if you're up for it, you can try to finish the entire game in 10 minutes. You're going to have to be both fast and a crack shot to have a hope of making that one. The Forever update should be available in February, so you'll at least have some time to practice.",vr
Daniel Cooper,"Rockstar North lead Leslie Benzies, a key figure in 'Grand Theft Auto' and 'Red Dead Redemption,' will develop VR equipment and games.",2017-01-24T09:29:00-05:00,Former 'Grand Theft Auto' lead starts his own VR studio,"Until 2014, Leslie Benzies was head of Rockstar North , responsible for hits like the Grand Theft Auto series and Red Dead Redemption. After an acrimonious split with his former employer and some time away, Benzies looks to be coming back to the game world. An investigation by The Scotsman reveals that the executive has registered a company -- VR-Chitect Limited -- with the aim of building VR headsets and equipment. The paper also found a series of other companies that Benzies has put his name to, including Starship Group and Everywhere Game Limited. Another, Royal Circus Games, has also trademarked the phrase Time for a New World, although that could just be a company slogan rather than anything more substantial. The fact that such an influential -- and successful -- figure in the games industry is striking out on his own is interesting. We'll wait and see what he's able to develop in the following months and years.",vr
Timothy J. Seppala,Add another lawsuit to the list for the automaker.,2017-01-23T23:48:00-05:00,Faraday Future sued over missed payments on $2 million VR video (update),"Faraday Future may have had a new car to show off at CES earlier this mont h, but everyone's left Las Vegas and old problems are cropping up. Now, the company is being sued by a video effects company for failure to pay for a virtual fly-through of one of its concept vehicles. Last September The Mill gave Faraday an estimate for how much it'd cost to produce a ""graphic presentation with virtual reality, augmented reality and holographic components"" for January's trade show, according to court documents obtained by Jalopnik. Faraday allegedly agreed to pay the $1,822,750 in three installments, but The Mill claims that it has only been paid once despite ""repeated requests."" And it wasn't the right amount, either. Instead of the agreed-upon $455,687.50, Faraday paid $20,000 for the work. It leaves a balance of $1,802,750 plus interest and other costs for the video. Since then, the automaker has racked up at least 64,124 reservation slots for its FF 91 SUV, but how many people ponied up for the $5,000 priority reservation isn't clear. Had that been the only way to pre-order (a free reservation was also offered) the company would've had over $320 million laying around -- more than enough to pay for the fancy holograms and VR video. The FF 91 is slated to begin production in 2018. We've reached out to Faraday for more information and will update this post should it arrive. Update: Faraday has issued the following statement: ""The Mill Group Inc. was brought in to Faraday Future to create Virtual Reality (VR) content for the FF 91 unveiling at CES. The Mill alleges that it is entitled to full payment for work that it performed. Faraday Future denies this contention, and looks forward to the opportunity to present the facts supporting its position through the legal process. Faraday Future prioritizes its strategic relationships with suppliers as a critical part of bringing our vision of future mobility to life. We are committed to fulfilling our financial obligations in a timely manner with all vendors, and by the same measure, will work to protect our business interests and company growth.""",vr
Steve Dent,"No news yet on the Playstation VR version, though.",2017-01-23T10:23:00-05:00,'Tekken 7' delayed to June 2,"After saying that it would arrive in early 2017, developer Bandai Namco revealed that Tekken 7 is coming to the Playstation 4, Xbox One and PC later, on June 2nd. ""We were trying our best to get the game out... as early as possible,"" director Katsuhiro Harada told GameSpot. However, he didn't want players to ""bash the product"" over lack of content, so ""we made some hard decisions and that was the result."" Tekken 7 is supposed to come to Playstation VR as well, but the company made no mention of that in its announcement. As a quasi-2D, third-person fighter, the title is an odd choice for virtual reality. However, as director Katsuhiro Harad told Engadget at E3 last year, a first-person game would probably be a bit too intense for VR. ""Imagine if your brother or sister or friend came up and started punching or kicking right in front of your face, how jarring that would be."" The company also revealed a few more details about the title. For one, if you preorder, you'll get a bonus character, Eliza, ""the vampire dark beauty of the Tekken roster."" Playstation 4 owners will also have exclusive content like legacy Tekken 4 and Tekken 2 costumes for characters King, Xiaoyu and Kin, along with a ""Jukebox Mode"" that lets you listen to and create playlists of old Tekken tracks. For the first time in the serries, buyers of the deluxe edition will get a season's pass, including a ""new playable characters, stages, a game mode, and a bonus 35-piece Metallic Costume Pack,"" Bandai Namco said.",vr
Sean Buckley,'Wide Awake' VR experience offers a glimpse at an inevitable future: Donald Trump's first midnight call.,2017-01-20T17:54:00-05:00,Trump at 2AM: The new Oval Office in virtual reality,"Donald Trump stands before me with a grim look on his face, lightly leaning against the Oval Office's Resolute desk. Moonlight pours in through the office's rear windows as a phone quietly rings. It's 2am, and something has happened -- and a new President holds the weight of the world on his shoulders. I'm looking at this surreal, frozen scene through the lens of an HTC Vive. It's a free virtual reality experience called ""Wide Awake,"" and it tells a simple, concise story: no matter who Donald Trump was before or what you may have thought of him, he's now the guy who answers the phone when shit hits the fan. Staring at the President's visage through virtual reality is a little like visiting a wax museum. Donald Trump stands unmoving, frozen in time -- but his face looks like it could spring to life at any moment. The VR experience's description boasts that virtual Trump is the ""most photo-realistic human you will see in virtual reality today,"" and he really is. Standing at the President's official height of 6'3 , virtual Trump towers over me, his face creased with intensity. His left knee bends slightly off the ground. As the phone rings, it's hard to tell if he's sitting back in reflection, or preparing to spring off the desk into action. The ambiguity seems intentional. ""We see Trump in VR as art,"" co-creator John MacInnes explains. ""A tableau vivant, in the American tradition of artists like Edward Hopper in painting, Gregory Crewdson and Cindy Sherman in photography."" Indeed, Wide Awake serves as a living picture -- it's as frozen as a painting, but a light in the player's hand gives them some control over how the scene looks. And while the subject is frozen, the world around him isn't. The ringing phone continues to add tension to the scene. Who is this new president? What is his reaction to a middle of the night emergency? The work doesn't answer this question -- it merely offers a view of public service the average citizen will never see. Someday soon, Donald Trump will be awoken by a midnight call and rush to the West Wing. He'll be called upon to make life and death decisions most of us can scarcely imagine. The experience was actually created before the election, but was only released to the public on the Vive store on the dawn of Donald Trump's inauguration. It has more impact this way, portraying a definite future instead of a potential one. It's also an incredibly surreal experience to have just minutes after the President is sworn in.",vr
Devindra Hardawar,It premiers at Sundance today and is also available to Rift owners.,2017-01-20T11:00:00-05:00,'Dear Angelica' from Oculus shows the power of VR illustration,"Illustration is an unusual choice for a virtual reality experience. After all, when you can build and render fully-realized 3D worlds, relying on drawings alone almost feels like a step back. But that didn't stop Oculus from pursuing a bold new animated style for its next short, Dear Angelica. In fact, the company had to build a new VR tool (Quill, its VR drawing software) to make the film. The end result is a truly unique short -- one that shows that virtual reality can be immersive even when you're basically looking at static images. It's premiering at the Sundance Film Festival and will be made freely available to Rift owners today. Dear Angelica centers on a young girl (voiced by Mae Whitman), who's coping with the death of her film star mother (Geena Davis). As she revisits memories of watching her mother's films, they're drawn out in front of you. It's all gorgeously rendered, with a wondrous sense of scale. In many ways, watching Dear Angelica is like stepping into an interactive motion comic; there's some wonderful illustration talent at work, but it's also buoyed by a bit of movement and changing camera perspectives. While the film isn't very long, you can pause and step through a scene at any point. And since there's sometimes a lot to take in -- I sometimes found myself spinning around trying to capture every detail of more epic scenes -- it'll likely reward repeated viewings. It's clear that Oculus spent a lot of time crafting Dear Angelica. Art director Wesley Allsbrook painted the entire experience on her own. And the voice work by Whitman (who narrates the bulk of the film) and Davis is genuinely moving. Rounding out the entire experience is some fantastic sound design, which makes the relatively small-scale short feel like a Hollywood blockbuster at times. Looking ahead, I hope Oculus can take the concept of VR illustration further to give us a fully animated experience. Dear Angelica is a tremendous accomplishment, especially since Allsbrook drew it on her own, but it would be intriguing to see what an even larger team can do. As an aficionado of animated films, I'd love to step into the equivalent of a traditional Disney or Miyazaki movie at some point. As the third VR short from Oculus Story Studio , Dear Angelica feels like a more focused effort. It's not trying to wow you like their first short, Lost , or relying on a fun cartoon animal to spark your interest, as Oculus did with Henry. At its core, Dear Angelica is a simple story of loss and grief, it's just told in a completely new way.",vr
Nick Summers,Something to pass the time while you wait for 'Resident Evil 7.',2017-01-20T08:46:00-05:00,PlayStation VR now supports 360-degree YouTube videos,"PSVR is still a young whippersnapper in the virtual reality world, striving for parity -- and in games, superiority -- with the Oculus Rift and HTC Vive. Today it's taken another step forward with support for 360-degree videos on YouTube. That means you can boot up anything on the platform, including a New York Times 'Daily 360' video , and move your head to change the perspective. You're stuck in one place, of course, but the experience is still fairly immersive, especially in comparison to the desktop YouTube experience (dragging around with your cursor isn't much fun). We've seen glimpses of this functionality before. A handful of early PSVR owners received the update last December , but said the quality of the service was poor. That's because the videos were capped at 1080p and had to be stretched to accommodate the headset's 100-degree field of view. We're hoping that Sony and Google have worked out the kinks -- a huge library of immersive 360 videos would make PSVR a more useful and attractive proposition. If nothing else, it'll tide us over while developers work on new VR games, like the much anticipated Resident Evil 7.",vr

The Google Street View rival has brought its virtual reality tours of various real-world locations to the iPhone. Matterport originally offered 3D views of everything from popular travel destinations to celebrity homes and historic places like the very first Boeing 737. It started going into VR late last year, though, and even launched a platform called CoreVR that makes it easy for content creators to turn their Street View-like shots into virtual reality experiences. The company has around 300,000 VR spaces, 150 of which make up a curated premium selection, that you can access through the iOS, Gear VR and Cardboard apps. It also promises to keep converting and adding the rest of its 3D spaces. Take note that the app will only work if you have an iPhone 5s or one of the device's newer iterations, and only if it's running iOS 9.1 and higher. In case you're a business owner looking to show off your place place in VR, though, you'll also need Matterport's $4,500 camera in addition to a new-ish iPhone.",vr

But what if those 3D paintings and projects you made while strapped into virtual reality could escape into the real world? That's the idea behind the open-source Tilt Brush Toolkit , available now on GitHub. The company is ""sharing all of our brush shaders, our audio reactive code, a streamlined Unity import pipeline"" and a few developer-specific features in an effort to get folks crafting wild-looking games, videos and experiences. To give those who are inclined a springboard Google has also included a couple of examples to work from, including a racing game and what UploadVR describes as a ""full first-person exploration piece with teleportation."" Perhaps most important here is the integration with the Unity game design toolset. The engine runs on practically every platform and is favored by indie developers -- especially those working within VR -- because of how versatile it is. That it's free for companies making under $100,000 a year is hard to ignore as well. For an idea of what's possible, peep the video embedded above. Hopefully it won't take long for these animated 3D sketches to show up in more places.

The founder of Oculus VR -- who has remained out of sight since his role in funding political trolls came to light -- sold his startup to Facebook for $2 billion in 2014, but ZeniMax (parent company of iD Software) claims its tech is based on code Oculus CTO John Carmack wrote while still an employee. According to Bloomberg , Luckey testified that while the company's software ran in a demonstration for investors, he also said ""I didn't take confidential code...I ran it and demonstrated it through the headset. It is not true I took the code."" The Zenimax lawsuit challenges Oculus' origin story, claiming that Luckey lacked the expertise to develop VR technology. Gizmodo reports that a line of questioning focused on his lack of a college degree, while Facebook's lawyers pumped up his hobbyist interests and stories of electronics tinkering in the garage. Back in 2014, Carmack stated that ZeniMax owns the code he wrote while working there but ""they don't own VR."" According to Oculus, Luckey sent Carmack a headset in 2012, and showed off a ported version of Doom 3 for it, before leaving iD to join the company in 2013. UploadVR says that former Oculus CEO Brendan Iribe is expected to testify as well, and a jury verdict could occur as soon as next week.",vr
Tom Regan,PSVR's big multiplayer hope is all but dead after the closure of Guerilla Cambridge.,2017-01-18T15:35:00-05:00,PSVR mech battler 'Rigs' won't get any new content,"Sony today confirmed that there will be no more DLC coming to multiplayer PSVR launch title Rigs. Following the recent closure of developer Guerilla Cambridge, it seems Sony has opted to cut short its initial plan for additional Rigs content. While the ambitious mech-based multiplayer shooter won itself a loyal fan base amongst early PSVR adopters, Sony's decision to close Guerilla Cambridge suggests that the game's sales weren't quite up to expectations. Despite the closure, Sony told Eurogamer that Rigs ' online servers will be unaffected, with the game still scheduled to receive patches and other ""community support"". Formerly known as SCEE Cambridge, Guerilla Cambridge developed games for Sony for almost twenty years, making its name with the release of seminal PlayStation classic - MediEvil. While Rigs was the developer's first and last PSVR release, the studio spent most of its time making games for PlayStation's handhelds. The developer's lengthy career saw it not only bring MediEvil to the PlayStation Portable, but also big Sony franchises to handhelds, creating games like Little Big Planet PSP and Killzone: Mercenary for Vita. In the run up to launch, Rigs ' unique brand of fast-paced mech mayhem meant that it was hotly tipped as one of the jewels in PSVR's crown. With the studio managing to weather the storm of both the PSP and Vita's middling sales, however, Guerilla Cambridge's recent closure doesn't exactly bode well for PSVR's future. Despite happily sharing PS4 sales figures , Sony has also remained ominously quiet about how its virtual reality platform has actually performed. This reluctance to disclose sales coupled with a lack of PSVR announcements at last month's PlayStation Experience means that Sony's silence on PSVR feels deafening. With this month's Resident Evil 7 and March's Star Trek Bridge Crew serving as the platform's only major 2017 releases so far, Sony will need to work quickly to reassure early PSVR adopters that it was worth investing in the expensive new tech.",vr

With the new Zbox Magnus EN1070K from Zotac, however, that tower is now barely bigger than a Mac Mini. The EN1070K is part of Zotac's gaming line of ultra-compact PCs, but don't let its minuscule footprint fool you. It offers the current Intel Kaby Lake Core i5 processor, an NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1070 GPU and can accommodate up to 32GB of RAM. That's more than enough processing power to run a VR setup such as the Oculus Rift. There's no word yet on when the EN1070K will be released, or for how much. Given that the last generation E-series cost around $1,500, you can pretty safely bet the new one will retail for roughly the same, depending on the specific components you select. So even though it may be small enough to fit into a VR backpack , the EN1070K's price tag may be too big to fit into your budget.",vr
